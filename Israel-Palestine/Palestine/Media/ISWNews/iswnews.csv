🔸General Michael Erik Kurilla, Commander of CENTCOM, arrived in Riyadh to meet with the Chief of Staff of the Saudi Armed Forces and representatives of the resigned Yemeni government, and to visit American bases in the region.

▪️Kurilla met with General Fayyad bin Hamed Al-Ruwaili, Chief of Staff of the Saudi Armed Forces, and other Saudi military commanders to discuss security issues, mutual commitment, and joint cooperation to address evolving threats in the region. They emphasized the importance of joint military maneuvers and the strategic partnership between their countries.

▪️Kurilla also met with Lieutenant General Saghir bin Aziz, Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the resigned Yemeni government (aligned with the Saudi coalition), in Riyadh. They focused on strengthening security cooperation, combating Ansar Allah, and enhancing the operational capacity.

👉 These discussions suggest that the United States, in exchange for providing military weapons to the resigned Yemeni government, seeks intelligence cooperation and participation in ground attacks on Ansar Allah positions.

✍️ Kurilla’s visit to Riyadh marks the beginning of a comprehensive and decisive plan to create a coalition against Ansar Allah. Airstrikes by the Israeli army and the American-British coalition against Yemen have had limited impact on reducing the operations of Yemeni armed forces against Israel. The United States is aiming for increased attacks on Yemen by forming a new coalition with Saudi Arabia and the resigned Yemeni government.

📝 The Israeli security agencies' focus on building underground bases shows a correct assessment of Iran's strengths. Instead of spending on multiple defense layers with radar and missile systems, they have opted for underground bases.

👉 If Israel relocates its strategic bases and weapons underground, Iran's opportunity for effective missile attacks on the occupied territories and their military equipment will be significantly reduced.

Deputy Foreign Minister of Azerbaijan Yalchin Rafiyev met with Syrian transitional government Foreign Minister Asad Hassan Al-Shaybani in Damascus on December 29.

▪️During the meeting, both sides agreed to begin a new chapter in long-term relations between Azerbaijan and Syria, focusing on friendship and cooperation. The Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry issued a statement: ""Together with Turkey, this country stands by Syria at this important stage and will support the reconstruction process.""

One key issue raised was the reopening of Azerbaijan's embassy in Damascus after 12 years.

A convoy of 10 trucks carrying 200 tons of food has departed from Baku, Azerbaijan's capital, bound for Syria. The convoy will enter Idlib via Georgia and Turkey, with aid provided through the Turkish Disaster and Emergency Management Agency (AFAD).

👉 Turkey, a main supporter of the Tahrir al-Sham Front and the Syrian interim government, maintains close relations with Baku in all matters. With Turkey's active support, relations between Baku and Damascus are expected to increase significantly in various fields in the coming months.

👉 After the start of the Gaza war, tensions between Turkey and the Israeli regime escalated due to verbal disputes between Erdogan and Netanyahu. Baku, with its extensive economic, political, and military ties to both the Turkish government and the Israeli regime, can act as an effective mediator and facilitator between Ankara and Tel Aviv. Thus, one of Baku's main reasons for seeking to reduce tensions in Syria is to promote cooperation and alignment between Israel and Turkey.

🔹According to Hebrew media, Turkish government officials have sent messages to Israel, proposing the establishment of a coordination mechanism with the Israeli army, similar to the relationship between Moscow and Tel Aviv.

🔹In 2015, Israel and Russia agreed to coordinate operations in Syria, which involved direct communication between the Kremlin and the Israeli Prime Minister, as well as between the highest levels of security, including the Russian National Security Council and the Israeli Internal Security Advisor. There was also a direct connection between the Russian Hmeimim base and the Israeli army intelligence department in the occupied Golan.

👉 By seeking close contact with Tel Aviv and establishing a new coordination mechanism, Ankara aims to increase its influence and play a more significant role in Syrian affairs, enhancing its position as a major player in the country's political landscape. 

👉 It is likely that Israel will accept this proposal, using Turkey's close relations with the Syrian transitional government and armed groups in Syria as a mediator and leverage to manage possible tensions with the militants and to gain strategic advantages in southern Syria against the current and future government in Damascus.

2024-12-29T08:58:54+00:00,-1001458314607,"🇺🇸🇮🇱 THAAD System Deployed: U.S. Assists Israel with First Official Use

▪️A military reporter for Israel’s Channel 11 released a video showing the activation of the American THAAD system to intercept a Yemeni missile over the occupied territories during Friday morning’s Yemeni attack on Tel Aviv.

In mid-October, the United States deployed two or three THAAD anti-ballistic missile system batteries, along with about 100 American military personnel, in the occupied territories. Initially, the THAAD system was deployed to counter potential Iranian retaliatory attacks on sensitive Israeli sites. However, it seems that following the failure of the Israeli Arrow-2 and Arrow-3 anti-ballistic missile systems to counter Yemeni hypersonic missiles, the THAAD system was brought in to assist.

According to Israeli sources, this marks the first activation of the THAAD system since its deployment in occupied Palestine. In the video, American military personnel excitedly exclaimed, “18 years waiting for this!”

🔎 But how effective is THAAD really?

▫️In short, against one or two ballistic missiles, the THAAD system is quite effective. However, it struggles against a large number of incoming missiles.

📊 Each THAAD system battery has 6 launchers, each with 8 missiles, totaling 48 missiles per battery. The United States has 7 THAAD batteries, which are strategically important for defending sensitive American locations. Lockheed Martin, the manufacturer of THAAD, has produced and delivered about 800 THAAD missiles to the US Army. Of these, 336 are needed for the 7 American batteries, with the remainder in reserve.

Given this information, it’s clear why the US has provided Israel with two to three batteries of the THAAD system. The production of THAAD systems and missiles is limited, and the United States cannot supply all the THAADs and missiles it needs to Israel.

📊 If Israel has three THAAD batteries, that means 144 interceptor missiles are ready for use, supplemented by a small portion of the US THAAD missile reserves.

👉 As we said, the primary purpose of deploying these systems in Israel is to counter Iranian attacks. However, the system can easily become overwhelmed by a large volume of missiles, such as 200 in a single operational mission, significantly reducing its defensive capabilities. The key to the success of Yemeni attacks, similar to Iran’s approach, lies in effectively saturating these systems. The more hypersonic missiles are fired, the higher the success rate of Yemeni operations!

After several days of inactivity in southern Syria, the Israeli army entered the villages of Suwysah and Dawayeh in southern Quneitra province.

▪️In recent days, the southern Syrian front has seen a halt in Israeli army movements and an increase in popular protests against their occupation in the border areas of Quneitra and Daraa provinces. Despite these protests, Israeli forces continue to establish military outposts and positions in the UNDOF buffer zone and the heights of Mount Hermon.

▫️In its latest actions, the Israeli army has deployed tanks and military vehicles on the outskirts of the Al-Mantara Dam, east of the village of Quneitra. Additionally, Israel has established specific rules, including designated entry and exit times for residents of the villages of Umm Al-Adham and Al-Adnaniyah, which are situated south of the Al-Mantara Dam.

👉 Israel’s actions in occupying southern Syria indicate that the regime’s officials are ignoring Abu Muhammad al-Julani’s recent statements that the new Syria adheres to the 1974 disengagement agreement and prevents attacks on Israel.

The negative reactions from regional and international parties have not changed Israel’s position. In fact, the US unwavering support for Israel, the ambiguous stance of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) regarding the new Syrian government, and Israel’s advantage in the Palestinian-Lebanese conflict have created a situation in the region that the Zionists deem favorable for further advances in Syria.

👉 This morning, militants from the Islah Party attacked Ansar Allah positions at the air defense base and Al-Qari' height on the northern front of Taiz, but these assaults were repelled by Ansar Allah fighters.

▪️A ground attack on Ansar Allah is considered to be part of a strategy by the US and Israeli regime aimed at reducing the pressure caused by Ansar Allah's missile and drone attacks on occupied Palestine, as well as addressing the naval blockade imposed on Israel.

▪️In this context, American military advisors have consistently urged the Southern Transitional Council, Al-Amaliqa forces, Tariq Saleh, and other groups aligned with the Saudi coalition to initiate a military offensive against Ansar Allah positions. However, these efforts have not yet yielded results.

👉 It is important to note that the groups affiliated with the Saudi coalition lack the specialized capabilities and resources necessary to effectively engage Ansar Allah on their own. However, their combined forces and coordinated actions could pose a challenge to Ansar Allah.

The F/A-18F “Super Hornet” fighter is the first American fighter jet to be shot down in the recent conflict.

▪️On the third day of Israeli ground operation in Syria, Israeli forces captured Jabatha al-Khashab and al-Hurriya in Quneitra province, along with the villages of Arna, Baqasem, al-Rima, al-Haina, Qala Jandal, and al-Husayniyyah in Damascus province. These areas lie on the Syrian-Lebanese border strip and are approximately 25 km from the Syrian capital, Damascus.

▫️ These advances suggest Israel's intention to establish a buffer zone on the Syrian-Lebanese border, aiming to cut off Syria's supply route to Lebanon and facilitate a ground attack on eastern Lebanon.

▫️ Currently, the Israeli army has the areas of Qatna and Yafour ahead of them to continue their advance, and then the road leading to the Al-Masna' border crossing.

▫️ The Qatna area, strategically located on the hills overlooking Lebanon, also connects to Yafour and the border road, making it the likely next target for Israel.

On the eighth day of fighting, it appears that the Syrian army has consolidated and stabilized its defense lines in northern Hama, halting the militants' advance on this axis.

▪️ Tahrir al-Sham and the militants of the so-called Fatah al-Mubin operations room have concentrated their attacks on the Jabal Zayn al-Abidin front.

▫️ Currently, the most intense clashes are ongoing in Maar Shahur and around Kafraa. The reports that militants have full control over Maar Shahur are inaccurate at this time. Given the Syrian army's superiority from Jabal Kafraa to the surrounding areas, the village of Kafraa and its surroundings are not under militant control and, at worst, are abandoned by both sides.

👉 Generally, as long as the important heights of Zayn al-Abidin and Kafraa remain under Syrian army control, militants will not be able to advance directly towards the city of Hama or capture Qomhanah.

▪️Fighting continues on other fronts, including the Khattab front and north of Mahrada in the Tal Malah and al-Jalmah areas.

A brief overview of the conflict lines in northern Hama shows that the areas under control of the parties have returned to a situation similar to the lines of 2016 and 2017.

▪️The Israeli cabinet is currently reviewing the plan, with their response expected to be announced in Netanyahu's speech.

▪️The Lebanese government will convene tomorrow morning to approve the ceasefire agreement.

▪️The ceasefire involves a 60-day phased agreement, which can be extended in future rounds.

👉 Hezbollah utilized all its resources to support the Gaza Strip during the 14-month conflict with the Zionist regime, significantly engaging Israel’s military forces and alleviating pressure on Gaza. Despite these efforts, the war persisted. Resistance axis leaders believe that extending the conflict in southern Lebanon under the present conditions is not advisable. They view a ceasefire on this front as a beneficial move for the entire resistance axis.

▪️The Sparrow missiles are a series of Israeli medium-range air-launched ballistic missiles (ALBMs) designed for two main purposes: testing the Arrow anti-ballistic missile system and conducting offensive operations against adversaries.

▪️Air-launched ballistic missiles, launched from fighter jets, can be highly effective and strategically advantageous for attacking targets. 

▪️The Israeli regime deployed Sparrow and ROCKS missiles in its attacks on Iran on April 19 and again on October 26. While detailed information about these missiles is scarce, the examination of published images and the remnants of the missile boosters reveals some intriguing insights.

▪️On the Deir Mimas axis, Hezbollah's continuous ATGM attacks on Israeli forces and armored vehicles, along with the Israeli military's failure to advance towards Qaliya and Burj al-Muluk, have forced the Israeli army to withdraw its forces from Deir Mimas and retreat.

👉 Given the Israeli army's tactics, there is a possibility that they will attack Deir Mimas again. They withdrew their infantry and armored forces from Deir Mimas to avoid further casualties.

▪️Such attacks are effectively pressuring the Israeli government to agree to a ceasefire. A ""Tel Aviv versus Beirut"" dynamic will emerge once Hezbollah delivers significant and impactful strikes on Israel.

Israeli media report that Amos Hochstein, the US President's advisor and special envoy to Lebanon, has recently informed both the Lebanese and Israeli sides that they have limited time to reach a ceasefire agreement. If they do not agree this time, he will cease his mediation efforts. This pressure is primarily directed at Netanyahu, as the Lebanese government is more ready than Israel to implement a ceasefire.

The attack on the radar site in al-Suwayda may be meant to facilitate more attacks on northern Syria, or even to prepare for an attack on Iran or its allies in Iraq.

Israel has already vowed to strike back if Iran retaliates for the October 26 attack on Iranian targets. Recent Hebrew media reports also said that the Israeli military could attack Iraq in response to repeated drone attacks by Iran-backed armed factions there.

But what makes this launch interesting are the two tweets by the account attributed to the Semnan Space Command that were published in this period.

▪️The first tweet was published on the morning of November 7: ""We will blind your eyes, which are constantly observing the air and space in these restless nights, so that you will not be able to see what is coming towards you. We will cut off the blood supply to the components of your power and make the components of your power weak. And the world will witness this wonder...""

The filming of this video took place after the assassination of Sayyed Hassan and demonstrated that the regime’s claims about the destruction of Hezbollah’s missile capabilities are baseless.

Khoramshahr-4 is the 4th generation of Iran’s Khorramshahr series of missiles, which was unveiled on May 25, 2023 by the Ministry of Defense of Iran. 

The range of this missile is 2000 km and its 1500 kg warhead is considered one of the heaviest warheads of Iranian missiles. The use of hypergolic fuel, the advanced “Arvand” engine, the speed of Mach 16 outside the atmosphere and Mach 8 inside the atmosphere, and the ability to guide and control the warhead in the mid-phase exoatmosphere are among the distinctive features of Khorramshahr-4.

According to official military sources, the range of Khorramshahr-4 missile is up to 2000 km; But based on some facts, it seems that the range of the missile is intentionally announced lower than its actual range! Experts believe that the real range of this missile is up to 4000 km.

▪️The conflicts in the al-Khiam front, like other fronts in southern Lebanon, were accompanied by air and artillery strikes from the Tel Aviv regime’s military. However, the geographical position of this region and the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah’s determination to defend it forced the Israeli military forces to temporarily cease their assault on the town.

▪️Al-Khiam town overlooks the surrounding lands and is well-positioned to repel ground assaults. By deploying anti-tank missiles and rockets in this area and other heights, Hezbollah can easily monitor the Israeli army’s ground movements in the open lands on both sides of al-Khiam and carry out attacks on them in locations such as Sarda Farms, Al-Amara, northern Kfarkala, and other areas.

The Tel Aviv regime also failed to dominate al-Khiam town during the 33-day war, but today’s conflict is much heavier and more complex than those days.

Lebanon’s Prime Minister Najib Mikati criticized Iran and Iraq for dispatching aid in an interview on Wednesday night, urging the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah to evacuate southern Lebanon as soon as possible and hand over its weapons.

Mikati considered US special envoy Amos Hochstein’s visit to the Israeli-occupied territories and Lebanon a good indicator of progress in the ceasefire negotiations and reiterated his commitment to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1701.

The premier also called for the handover of southern Lebanon and Hezbollah’s weapons to the army and addressed Iran and Iraq, saying that if the two countries want to send aid, it should be delivered by sea; because “we do not want to jeopardize Beirut airport! We will not put anyone at risk to reopen the Syrian border.”

He also addressed the war refugees, saying that Beirut’s schools are not their hotel!

Mikati’s verbosity kicked off following the assassination of Secretary General of Hezbollah Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and intensified with Hochstein’s recent visit to Beirut. The path he is taking has already been followed by Former Prime Minister of Lebanon Saad Hariri, ultimately leading to his resignation and political removal.

Mikati is relying on Hochstein’s promises and is of the opinion that the issue of Hezbollah has been settled with Sayyed Hassan’s martyrdom. The situation in Lebanon is dire, but the removal of Hezbollah is nothing more than an illusion, and Mikati is not more powerful than Saad Hariri!

Ghadir or Qadir early-warning radar with a range of 1100 km and capable of tracking targets to a height of 300 km. The radar has the ability to detect air targets, stealth aircraft, cruise and ballistic missiles, and low-orbit (LEO) satellites.

The strategic position of this radar and its long range is a vital capability and is considered an important piece of the puzzle of the country's integrated defense system.

Iran has a large number of these radars in different parts of the country and it is easy to replace them; However, the plan of this round of attacks by the Israeli regime and its accomplice, the US, to blind this point and create a hole in the mentioned air defense layer, is of great importance and must be carefully examined.

There should be no doubt that the F-16CJ/DJ Block 50/52 of the 480th Fighter Squadron that the US brought to the region on the night of the attack (https://t.me/iswnews/60198) have played a role in suppressing Iranian radars and air defenses in Ilam and Khuzestan.

According to the available information, at 04:16 am on Saturday, several hostile projectiles were intercepted over the Chahe Jam area of Shahroud, and two projectiles hit the halls after passing through the air defense layers.

Here, like in Parchin and Khojir, we don't see big explosions and fires. In fact, a week before the attack, an order had been issued to evacuate important equipment.

Shahroud site coordinates: 36.2342, 55.2823

The distance between the Shahroud site and the western border of Iran is about 900 km. Some believe that Israel may have used an unknown drone to target Iran's facilities, which, of course, considering the distance and time required for the return of the drone, seems unlikely, unless the drone used the Caspian Sea airspace to launch missiles.

Many believe that Israel will fire missiles at Iran from the sky of Iraq like last time. But another possibility that is not addressed is the use of tanker aircraft and the sky of international waters and attacking from the south.

Although this model of attack may not seem reasonable considering Iran's long-range radar capabilities and will probably destroy the ""element of surprise"" intended by Israel; However, it is by no means out of the question.

Iran has explicitly stated that any country that provides its skies to attack Iran will be Iran's next target. Iraq, whose situation is clear, and Saudi Arabia do not have any desire to have a conflict with Iran at the moment. So maybe Israel is looking for another way to attack.

For years, Israelis have been practicing simulating attacks on distant targets with the Americans. In recent months, they have attacked Yemen's Hudaydah twice in the same manner.

If Israel plans to use this strategy for the airstrikes, it's important to note that the regime's fighter jets, with aerial refueling support, may fly over the Red Sea, bypassing Yemen, and then launch missiles from the northern Arabian Sea.

It is important to mention that in recent weeks, several American refueling planes have entered the West Asian region in addition to what was already in the region. This could indicate preparations for a potential attack in the way that we mentioned.

The Fattah missile is the first example of Iranian hypersonic missiles that was unveiled in a special ceremony in Tehran on June 6. This missile, with a speed of more than 13 Mach in the midcourse phase and a speed higher than 5 Mach in the terminal phase and also with the ability to maneuver at a distance of 100 km before hitting the target, is considered a very big leap in Iran’s missile arsenal. In fact, the Fattah missile is a very advanced MaRV (Maneuverable Reentry Vehicle) ballistic missile that has tried to maintain a speed of 5 Mach or more throughout the maneuver and impact to be classified as a hypersonic missile.

▪️Israel’s ground attack on the countries of the region is a certain thing that first happened in the Gaza Strip, and then it will happen in Lebanon and Syria, and it may spread to other Arab countries. But how and when it is not clear.

The Zionists advance based on the existing conditions. When they feel unable to advance and fight, they enlist the support of America and the Europeans to establish a ceasefire as a last resort. They observe the other party’s reaction and analyze it. If they encounter strong determination, they retreat from conflict. However, if they sense any discord or weakness in the other party, they proceed to dismantle their enemy’s foundation. The current situation in Palestine and Gaza, as well as the future situations in Lebanon and Syria, along with Netanyahu’s dreams for the future of Iran and Yemen, support this perspective.

Upon initial observation, this attack may not seem very likely. However, upon considering the unstable situation of the Syrian army, the troubled areas of southern Syria, and the significant silence of the Syrian militants and the old opponents of the resistance in Daraa and Sweida, it becomes apparent that Syria does not have enough power to handle all the chaos and a potential full-scale Israeli invasion.

Israel’s advance with the help of Syrian militants and Takfiris may proceed more quickly compared to southern Lebanon. Although the Israeli army will not only be fighting the Syrian army in Daraa and Quneitra, but the resistance groups also have a strong presence there. So Israel will be engaged in a multifaceted battle in southern Syria.

2024-10-01T13:29:24+00:00,-1001458314607,"▪️In the past month, the leaders of the Zionist regime have been paying more attention to the situation in southern Lebanon and northern occupied Palestine, as well as focusing on carrying out terrorist operations in Lebanon. This “attention and concentration” was the result of Hezbollah’s effective intelligence-security operations against Israel and the successful operations of Lebanese, Iraqi and Yemeni resistance groups. These actions have made the situation unbearable for the Israeli regime.

▪️The targeted killings of Ismail Haniyeh, Saleh al-Arouri, Fuwad Shukr, Ibrahim Aqil, Ali Karaki, Mohammad Hossein Sarour, and numerous field commanders and senior members of Hezbollah did not lessen the pressure on the Israeli regime. Instead, the psychological impact of the resistance’s response to these assassinations heightened the process of evacuating settlers from northern occupied Palestine.

▪️This pressure was so heavy for the Zionists that once Amos Hochstein, the special adviser and special envoy of the US President in Lebanon, said in his last sentence that Nasrallah chose to escalate the war by rejecting the ceasefire proposal based on UN Resolution 1701. Exactly 10 days later, we witnessed the assassination of Seyed Hassan Nasrallah along with other officials of Hezbollah and Iran in Beirut.

▪️In any case, the chaotic situation in the West Asian region, especially the southern Lebanon-northern occupied Palestine front, has reached a point where there are speculations about a ground attack on Lebanon and even southern Syria.

⚔️Israel’s ground invasion of Lebanon is not new to Hezbollah, as a similar invasion occurred in 1982. During this war, Israeli forces attacked southern Lebanon under the pretext of avenging the assassination of its ambassador in the UK and pursuing the Palestinian Liberation Organization forces. With heavy air and artillery support, Israel quickly reached Beirut and surrounded the Palestinian, Lebanese, and Syrian forces in the west of the city.The war initially led to the expulsion of Palestinian forces from southern Lebanon and the suppression of Lebanese Islamist movements. However, with the formation of Hezbollah and the strengthening of other resistance groups in Lebanon, it turned into a war of attrition that eventually forced Israel to evacuate southern Lebanon.

⚔️In 2006, in the second Lebanon war, which is also known as the 33-day war, the Israeli army launched a ground attack on southern Lebanon and advanced one kilometer along the border strip of southern Lebanon, but at the end of the war, it retreated from these areas, and the war ended with United Nations Resolution 1701.

🔍 According to the UN Resolution 1701, Hezbollah must evacuate southern Lebanon and retreat to the north of the Litani River so that the Lebanese Army and UNIFIL forces can be deployed in these areas. Also, the Israeli army must withdraw its forces from the southern regions of Lebanon and adhere to the territorial integrity of this country.

▪️In general, Israel’s ground invasion of Lebanon is an idea that has serious supporters and opponents within the Israeli regime. The supporters of the ground attack view the situation positively, citing the assassination of senior Hezbollah commanders and the secretary general, the advancement of their military infrastructure, and the weak response of the resistance to consecutive attacks in Lebanon. On the other hand, opponents, reflecting on past events, present various reasons and urge the army to avoid taking risks in this area.

Following the recent 22-day military operation, the Israeli forces finally pulled out from all the areas where they had advanced eastern Khan Younis, the Al-Qarara axis, and Wadi al-Salqa, and retreated to their previous positions on the border of the Gaza Strip.

— There has been no change in the lines of contact, and the conflict between the Israeli military forces and Palestinian resistance fighters continue in the city of Rafah located in the southern Gaza Strip.

— The Israeli forces are still present on the Netzarim axis in the south of Gaza City, situated in the northern Gaza Strip. The confrontations are also underway in the regions in the vicinity of Tel al-Hawa and around the Islamic University of Gaza (IUG).

Given the process of the confrontations in the course of the past month, it seems that the regime’s military is not only incapable of capturing the Gaza Strip entirely, but also has slight desire to do so, and the fights have long entered a post-attrition stage.

The battles on the northern front of Palestine, the skirmishes in the West Bank, the uncertain condition in the Israeli-occupied territories due to the likelihood of a retaliatory attack by Iran, as well as the unclear and indecisive process of the indirect talks between the warrying parties for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip are among the reasons that have caused a relative tranquility in the circumstances in the besieged area.

Rear Admiral Christopher Alexander, who leads the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group, blamed the “loss of confidence” to command the guided-missile destroyer on Captain Yaste. This is an ambiguous reason that is often uttered in the United States’ military when it comes to elaborating the motive why a military person is discharged.

Given the lack of transparency on the reason behind the removal of the commander of the destroyer USS John S. McCain, as well as the mission of the US-UK coalition military fleet in West Asian waters, in particular against Yemen, it seems likely that this US commander was sacked due to his failure to confront the Yemeni Armed Forces’ missile and drone strikes.

Military analysts are of the opinion that the mistaken strike of the Tamir missile that targeted the Israeli Dvora-class fast boat may have been caused by Hezbollah’s sophisticated electronic warfare and jamming of the regime’s radar system.

Experts are probing into the possibility that Hezbollah used electronic warfare tactics to hamper the missile guidance system or generate a deceptive radar target that would mislead Iron Dome to detect the Israeli army boat as a hostile target.

The incident highlights the complexity and significance of modern warfare, which is a battlefield where other parties’ electronic warfare and radar deception jamming can have devastating repercussions. Reports published so far show that the Israeli regime would strengthen its defensive measures following the fatal incident.

Following these assaults, the Israeli regime’s infantry forces advanced on the eastern axis of Bani Suheila municipality with air support, and now confrontations between Israeli military forces and Palestinian resistance fighters are ongoing around Al-Alam Square and Dar es Salaam Hospital in Khan Younis city, located in the southern Gaza Strip.

The Israeli regime’s army also released the names of two military personnel and admitted that its troops had been killed in the Netzarim Corridor.

As a result of the killing of the two Israeli troopers, the number of assumed Israeli military fatalities following the initiation of the ground aggression on the Gaza Strip has increased to 332. Furthermore, the total number of “military” casualties, according to the Tel Aviv regime’s alleged statements, since the onset of the war has reached 692, while there are unofficial reports that emphasize the real number of Israeli military fatalities stands at around 4,000.

🗺 The exact location of the ambush in the Netzarim axis

The Netzarim Corridor is situated in southern of Gaza City. The title Netzarim has its roots in the name of the Israeli village of Netzarim, which was entirely evacuated by the regime in 2005 and handed over to the Gazans and then destroyed by the residents of the besieged strip. The Israeli regime shortly usurped this region during the three-week battle from December 27, 2008 until January 17, 2009, and again withdrew from the area following the termination of the military operation.

Over the course of the recent onslaught on the Gaza Strip, the Israeli regime’s army reentered this region with the aim of cutting off the land connection between Gaza City in the north of the Gaza Strip and the southern districts of the besieged enclave.

However, during the current confrontation, the Israeli military forces have expanded their presence with long-term objectives. In the ongoing aggression, the Israeli regime’s army erected four military posts on this axis. These four installations include a military post in the Juhur al-Dik area, a small military post on the Salah al-Din Road, a base in the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, and a large military base in the al-Rashid Street near the coastal areas.

👉 According to previous statements made by Israeli officials, the Israeli regime’s army is seeking to create a permanent security buffer zone along the Netzarim Corridor in the south of Gaza City, as well as across the borders of the Gaza Strip along with the occupied territories of Palestine. Thus, given the course of the clashes of the past few months and the objectives that the Tel Aviv regime has set for its military presence in this area, the possibility of Israel’s unilateral pull-out from the claimed buffer zones seems to be improbable.

✍️ Hamas’ statement comes as follows:

— “We cooperated with all the efforts made by the mediators in Qatar and Egypt, and showed flexibility concerning all the proposed suggestions to pave the way for reaching an agreement to halt the aggression against our nation as well as to finalize a prisoner swap deal.

— After listening to the mediators’ proposals in the ceasefire talks, it became obvious to us that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continues to get in the way of reaching a truce agreement.

— The new suggestions are in line with Netanyahu’s conditions and in the favor of the Zionist regime, especially because these proposals reject a permanent ceasefire and an all-out withdrawal of the Israeli regime’s military forces from the Gaza Strip.

— Netanyahu set new conditions regarding the prisoner swap deal and withdrew from other clauses of the existing proposal in a bid to prevent the finalization of the prisoner swap deal.

— We hold the Israeli prime minister fully responsible for hindering the endeavors made by the mediators as well as creating trouble in the way of achieving the ceasefire agreement and in respect of the lives of Israeli prisoners, who are exposed to the same risk to which the Palestinian people are exposed.

— We reaffirm our commitment to whatever we agreed to on June 2 and call on the mediators to show that they are assuming their responsibility and to force the Israeli foe to implement what has been agreed upon regarding the ceasefire deal.”

Following different rounds of indirect talks held in Egypt and Qatar, the warrying sides have yet to reach a deal. The endeavors have not yielded any tangible result because of Netanyahu’s refusal to cease the genocidal war on Gaza.

The devastating war has left more than 40,000 martyrs and over 92,600 wounded in Gaza. The onslaught has created a dire humanitarian situation which is being deteriorated because of restrictions imposed by the Israeli regime on entry of food and medicine.

The Israeli regime’s military personnel continue their aggression and genocidal war in the Gaza Strip in spite of the efforts made by regional and international players to pave the way for reaching a ceasefire deal in the besieged area.

The Israeli regime’s armed forces have kicked off new military operations in some regions since Saturday, and announced the compulsory evacuation of the areas of Al-Maghazi, Salah al-Din, Al-Farouq and Al-Amal neighborhoods, as well as blocks 973, 974, 978, 979, 1738 to 1745.

The Israeli regime claimed that its military forces launched the incursion because the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas and other resistance groups fired rockets from that area into the occupied territories of Palestine. However, it seems that the ground operations and the advances on the southern axes of the Gaza Strip, which are coincided with the ceasefire talks and international endeavors to reach a new truce agreement, are aimed at putting more pressure on the Palestinian resistance groups and squeezing more concessions in any possible ceasefire.

👉 In this respect, some Hebrew-language media outlets claimed that the Israeli cabinet under warmongering Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the regime’s army to exacerbate the intensity of the fighting in the Gaza Strip in order to enhance the regime’s upper-hand in the negotiations.

The Israeli regime’s army’s advancement to the shores of Rafah marks a pivotal moment in the evolving dynamics of the conflict, with implications reverberating across the region.

— In Rafah, a city at the heart of the conflict, clashes persist in multiple fronts, spanning the southern, western, and northern axes. Recent confrontations have seen targeted assaults by Israeli forces on vital locations such as Tel al-Sultan and the Saudi Housing in the city’s northern sector. Concurrently, efforts to secure and clear areas in the western part of Rafah are underway, underscoring the intensity of the ongoing military incursion.

— Insights from field sources within the Israeli regime shed light on the tactics employed by the Israeli army in Rafah. Despite lacking the requisite strength for a full-scale assault, Israeli forces are employing tactical approaches involving limited raids, strategic retreats, and iterative movements to consolidate control over the region incrementally. This strategy indicates a push by Israeli forces to expand their territorial influence along the coastal perimeters of Rafah.

Reports indicate a significant evacuation of approximately two-thirds of Rafah’s population, highlighting the humanitarian impact of the genocidal war. Furthermore, with around 35% of Rafah falling under Israeli occupation, the plight of civilians in the region is exacerbated, underscoring the urgent need for international intervention and humanitarian assistance.

In a tactical deployment towards Al-Bureij refugee camp in the central axis, the Israeli regime’s army has advanced several kilometers to support military operations aimed at the release of Israeli captives. However, these advancements are deemed temporary, with expectations of Israeli forces withdrawing from these areas in the near term, reflecting the fluid and dynamic nature of the conflict landscape.

The intensifying clashes in Rafah underscore the precarious situation faced by civilians caught in the Israeli plot for the region. Meanwhile, some reports point out to the fact that discussions regarding the reopening of the Rafah Crossing have hit a roadblock due to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s rejection of involving the Palestinians in overseeing the vital crossing.

— After two weeks of military operations and penetrating deep into Jabalia in the north of the Gaza Strip, the Israeli occupying forces have completely withdrawn from this area. As it was said before, the Israeli army never has the ability to clear, stabilize and establish a long-term presence in these areas, and the recent operations of the Israeli regime in Jabalia lacked any strategic goals. The only goal that may have been achieved was more destruction and killing in Jabalia.

— But in the south of the Gaza Strip in the Rafah axis, Israeli forces are slowly expanding their territories along the Egyptian border. During the last week, Israeli forces entered Tel Zaarab, the highest hill in the west of Rafah city. In the attack on Rafah, the Israeli army has adopted a strategy similar to the attack on Gaza City from the north. In the north of Gaza, the Israeli army slowly bypassed Gaza City using the coastal line, and in the next stages, from the east side, it cut off the Palestinian forces in the depth of Gaza. In Rafah, Israeli forces are slowly increasing the contact lines along the border, and probably in the next stages, with the addition of forces from the eastern axes, the Palestinian forces will be cut off in the center of Rafah.

— On the other hand, there are whispers of the possibility of establishing a comprehensive ceasefire in the Gaza Strip, but nothing is certain yet and we have to wait.

✈️ The Hermes 900 is a sophisticated, multipurpose unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) that serves as an upgraded version of the Hermes 450. This new model boasts enhanced capabilities, including a higher flight altitude that makes it well-suited for reconnaissance operations. The Israeli military has deployed the Hermes 900 extensively in the Gaza Strip, southern Lebanon, and Syria, where it has carried out numerous aerial missions.

🚀 However, Hezbollah’s air defense systems have proven more than capable of countering this advanced Israeli drone. By successfully downing the Hermes 900, the Lebanese resistance group has once again demonstrated its ability to neutralize the enemy’s aerial dominance and assert its own supremacy in the skies.

— This latest incident is a significant blow to the Israeli military’s aerial surveillance and intelligence-gathering capabilities. The loss of the Hermes 900 not only represents a financial and technological setback for Israel, but it also serves as a morale-boosting victory for Hezbollah and its supporters.

— The ongoing conflict between Hezbollah and Israel has been marked by a continued struggle for aerial superiority. As the Israeli military continues to invest in advanced drone technology, Hezbollah has responded by enhancing its air defense systems and honing its ability to detect and intercept these UAVs.

— The resistance group’s unwavering determination to defend its homeland and confront Israeli aggression remains unshakable, and it is willing to employ its technological and military prowess to achieve this objective.

— As the tensions in the region continue to simmer, the battle for aerial supremacy between Hezbollah and Israel is likely to intensify. The outcome of this ongoing struggle will have far-reaching implications for the balance of power in the Middle East and the ability of the Israeli military to conduct its operations without facing the constant threat of Hezbollah’s air defenses.

Analysis of the IWN indicates that this drone is of the Wing Loong-1 type, which belongs to the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

— In the early hours of the incident, sources opposed to the Ansar Allah movement claimed that this drone belonged to the movement, or some others referred to it as the main perpetrator of this attack. However, the Ansar Allah group never took responsibility for shooting down this drone.

— On the other hand, some speculations suggest that this drone was shot down by Al-Qaeda militants in Shabwah Governorate. This claim is consistent with the geographical location of the drone crash and the areas under Al-Qaeda control and influence in this Governorate. Additionally, considering the remains of the aforementioned drone, which were almost completely destroyed and burnt down, strengthens the speculation that the drone was destroyed by a foreign agent like Al-Qaeda.

👉 Examination of the wreckage of this drone by the IWN indicates that this UAV is most likely a Chinese Wing Loong 1 drone belonging to the United Arab Emirates.

— It is said that in the recent incident, the mentioned drone entered the Al-Rawdha area in Shabwah Governorate from the south and crashed in an uninhabited area. This indicates that the drone originated from the Balhaf and Razum coastal region. The Balhaf region has been under the control of Emirati forces for years, and there are also French occupiers in this area. Local sources from Balhaf and Shabwah have stated that the sky in this area has been witnessing daily flights of reconnaissance drones for years.

It should be noted that since the beginning of the war in Yemen, four UAE drones from the Wing Loong drone class have been shot down. The drone that crashed in the Al-Rawdha region in Shabwah Governorate on April 29, 2024 is the fifth Wing Loong UAV belonging to the UAE that has been shot down and destroyed in Yemen.

— For the first time, Israel is in complete contradiction to its security doctrine and is at war on its own soil on its northern borders.

— Since many years ago, war has been on the side of the enemy and not in our backyards. On the 7th of October, Israel entered the war with Hezbollah for the first time inside the northern areas, and the residents were evacuated from their homes by the decision of the government. This evacuation led to the creation of a security zone on Israeli soil where the war is taking place.

— This is not only a tactical problem, but also shows Israel's weakness and will become a dangerous precedent in the future.

— Hezbollah is moving to achieve strategic goals, and it is moving in this direction more than anything else with heavy fire against the Maren air control base, launching a drone at the Tal Shammayim balloon at the Golan intersection, and neutralizing surveillance tools.

— Seyyed Abdul Malik Badreddin al-Houthi, the leader of the Ansar Allah movement and the Yemeni revolution, in today’s speech about the latest developments in the region, clarified the dimensions of the enemy’s propaganda against the resistance and considered the recent actions of Iran and the members of the resistance axis based on religious, human and moral values.

🔸The important parts of today’s speech by the leader of the Ansar Allah movement about the latest developments in the region are as follow:

➖ During the occupation of Palestine, Western countries not only did not stand up against the brutal and horrible crimes of the Zionists, but also supported the Zionists.

➖ Accepting the membership of an occupation regime like Israel, whose existence is based on cruelty and crime, is shameful for the United Nations.

➖ Arab negligence caused the enemy to occupy Quds and the rest of Palestine. During the occupation of Palestine, contrary to today’s enemy propaganda, there was no “Iranian” label (influence), and Tehran’s government (before the 1979 revolution) had no differences with the US. The enemy tries to advertise the problem as an Iranian issue, which is superficiality, deception and naivety.

➖ Showing the Arabs and Israel’s problem as unimportant is stupidity and mockery of people. The Arabs have a responsibility to confront Israel.

➖ The action of Iran and any other Islamic country in supporting Palestine is based on religious values.

➖ The US and Europeans are greedy for the wealth and colonization of our country.

➖ We hope that as long as the war against Gaza continues, student protests in America and the West will continue during the summer holidays.

➖ It was the US that drew the plan, method and manner of Israel’s land invasion of Rafah.

➖ The resistance of the mujahideen of different Palestinian groups, led by the Qassam and Quds Briagdes, defeated the Israeli enemy.

➖ The return of the war in Jabalia and Al-Zaytoun shows that the enemy has been defeated. In some areas, there has been a war for the fifth time, and each time Israel declares that it has won! The longer the war lasts, the heavier the enemy’s defeat.

➖ On the front of Yemen and the battle of the promised victory and holy jihad, 40 operations with 211 missiles (in total) have been carried out against the Zionist enemy. In this week, seven operations were carried out with 13 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean.

➖ The Americans, the British and the Israelis are looking to change the course in the Indian Ocean to the east, and this entails more costs for them.

➖ Companies that transport goods to Israel will be targeted at any point within reach of the Yemeni army. Some countries and companies had a positive understanding of the situation and stopped shipping to Israel from this route. I hope that China, Russia and some other countries will understand this situation and stop shipping to Israel. It is in everyone’s interest to stop shipping goods to Israel from any direction, even the Mediterranean Sea.

➖ Our action to put pressure on Israel is humane and moral and to stop the crimes and genocide against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip.

➖ Enemies are creating defense belts to protect themselves and their ships in the Mediterranean Sea. As they failed in the previous operation phase, God willing, they will also fail in the fourth phase of intensifying the operation.

➖ God willing, the Iraqi brothers will join us in the fourth stage. We spare no efforts to strengthen the fourth stage of escalation.

➖ The amount of enemy media attacks on the Yemen front is more than any other front.

➖ I ask the dear people to hold a march in Sana’a and other provinces tomorrow, God willing.

2024-05-09T18:39:56+00:00,-1001458314607,"🇾🇪 Seyyed Al-Houthi: Israel Is A Threat To World Security And Peace!

Seyyed Abdul-Malik Badruldeen al-Houthi, the leader of the Ansar Allah Movement and the Yemeni Revolution, gave a speech about the latest situation in Palestine and developments in the region:

➖ Israel’s occupation of the Rafah crossing not only targets the Palestinian people, but is also an action against the people and the Egyptian army. This invasion is a security challenge for Egypt and is a provocation and humiliation for Arabs and Muslims.

➖ When the Americans say that they agree to carry out operations in Rafah on the condition that civilians are evacuated, they signal to Israel to occupy the Rafah crossing. They clearly encouraged Israel to occupy Rafah and provided large shipments to the Israeli enemy, so they are complicit in this crime.

➖ The purpose of this aggression is to double the suffering, siege and hunger of the Palestinian people. Rafah is not a military front, but a civilian area, and its capture does not bring any military gains for the enemy.

➖ Arabs and Muslims are obliged to take more measures in response to the attack on Rafah. They should not be spectators of this situation. Egypt should be at the forefront of this movement and take a firm stand against the attack of the Israeli enemy on Rafah.

➖ Arab countries have many political, diplomatic and economic options to respond to this action.

➖ (Addressing the rulers of Arab countries) If you do not dare to act against Israel, let the people answer them. Issuing your statement does not eliminate any risk. Accepting defeat and your passivity will not help you against the enemy.

➖ The hatred of the Zionists towards the Arabs and Muslims starts from the education of their children and affects their mental state as a complex.

➖ It is dangerous for a human being to witness the injustices that are happening in Gaza and not take any action, not show any reaction and not feel responsible.

➖ We admire the student movement in different countries including America and Europe because it is a human voice that expresses their nature.

➖ In the West, insulting God and insulting God’s prophets is not a problem, but criticizing Jews is forbidden, and even asking for an end to the killing of children in Gaza is forbidden!

➖ Political and media support of the Islamic world is important for the student movement.

➖ We praise Türkiye’s action to limit trade relations with the Israeli enemy. We hope that this step of Türkiye will lead to the complete termination of trade relations. We hope that other Arab countries that have business relations with Israel will follow the example of Turkey, and we hope that the embargo on the goods of American and Israeli companies will also expand.

➖ Targeted ships reached 112 ships and 10 operations were carried out this week with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and suicide drones. In the month of Shawwal, 25 operations were carried out with 71 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones.

➖ From now on, we are also thinking about the 5th and 6th stages of escalation and we are considering more important and sensitive options for the enemies. There are no red lines for our operations. Two things are important to us when conducting operations: legal and ethical controls, and the level of our capabilities. According to our abilities, we seek to achieve bigger goals.

➖ Israel is the enemy of our nation and is a danger and threat to world security and peace. This enemy only understands the language of force and the Islamic Ummah should pay attention to the power of deterrence.

➖ If every Arab and Islamic country took a proper position and cooperated with each other, the current situation would not have happened.

➖ I ask our people to start a million march tomorrow and tell the Palestinian people in Gaza and Rafah and all over Palestine: “You are not alone and we are with you until victory.”

— The fire broke out in one of the rented warehouses of the online retailer Wildberries Company. According to local emergency services, the incident was quickly brought under control and all the people present in the building were evacuated on time, and no one was harmed. It is reported that one person was arrested by the security forces during this incident, and the cause of the fire has been cited as human interference.

— According to speculations by local sources, the arson of the Wildberries warehouse is believed to be in protest and reaction to the crimes of the Israeli regime against the innocent people of the Gaza Strip.

👉 The Wildberries Company is the largest online retail company in Russia. The retail company was founded in 2004 by Tatyana Bakalchuk. In addition to Russia, WildBerries provides services to customers in Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and the Israeli regime.

— The Wildberries Company has close ties with the Israeli regime and has been selling in the occupied territories since December 8, 2020. The European part of the Wildberries website also lists the Israeli regime as one of the locations where it operates.

👉 The president and largest shareholder of this company (99%) is Tatyana Bakalchuk, who has deep connections with the Israeli regime. Tatyana Bakalchuk’s husband, Vladislav Bakalchuk, is also one of the founders of WildBerries Company and has strong connections with the Israeli regime.

👉 Vladislav’s uncle, Yona Bakalchuk, lives in the city of Petah Tikva in Tel Aviv. This person has been the strategic sales manager of the international IT company Matrix Global Services for the past 20 years. His clients include the Ministry of Defense of the Israeli regime and the General Staff of the regime’s army, along with other big names.

— Vladislav also has another cousin in St. Petersburg who owns three media companies with multi-million dollar incomes. The most successful of them, with an income of 400 million rubles in 2020, is the advertising agency Northern Capital, which was used by the famous Israeli man Mark Wolfson, the head of NTV-Mira Israel.
Mark Wolfson

👉 Another notable point is that one of the members of this company, with the position of cyber security analyst, named Alexander Mikhalchenko, is an Israeli who lives in the occupied territories and in Tel Aviv. The speculation is that the software support and cyber security of this company is likely based in Tel Aviv.

✍️ All these connections and relationships between this company and the Israeli regime strengthen the speculation about the targeted nature of the fire in the Wildberries warehouse. It should be noted that on January 16, 2023, one of the main warehouses of this company in the village of Shushary in St. Petersburg, Russia, also experienced a severe fire, with an area of about 70,000 square meters, and the Wildberries Company suffered about 15 billion rubles in damages in that incident.

✍️ Currently, about 1,000 companies affiliated to the Israeli regime are operating in the Central Asian region, connecting with Zionists through intermediaries.

— America has targeted the entire Islamic world. All Muslims are in the same boat. If the enemy is able to penetrate into an Islamic land, he will develop this infiltration and it must be blocked.

— We block the enemy in the eastern Mediterranean. We widen the front so that the enemy is divided. Islamic lands should be a field of jihad against the arrogant because we have a common enemy and a common destiny and ideal. We cannot live apart from each other.

— The task of the Quds Force is to prevent the enemy from infiltrating the Islamic world. By doing this, we have defended both the national security of our country and the security and dignity of other Muslims.

✏️ According to Hezbollah officials, the southern Lebanon-northern Palestinian front has been activated to help the Palestinian resistance in the Gaza Strip and reduce the pressure on them, and it is not possible to stop the conflict on this front without stopping the war in the Gaza Strip. Therefore, France's proposal to stop the war between Israel and Hezbollah, regardless of the developments in Gaza, is fundamentally invalid and certainly not enforceable.

✏️ Assuming that the cessation of the war in the south of Lebanon is also accompanied by the cessation of the war in the Gaza Strip, the withdrawal of Hezbollah from the southern regions of Lebanon is also impossible. The people of the southern regions of Lebanon have been among the leaders of the formation of resistance in Lebanon. How should they withdraw from their houses and properties in the south of Lebanon?

— The UAE Al-Arab newspaper claimed that this agreement includes the cessation of any military intervention in Yemen and the lifting of the air and sea blockade by Saudi Arabia, in exchange for Ansar Allah’s commitment to Saudi Arabia’s sovereignty and the cessation of cross-border attacks against this neighboring country.

— According to this agreement, the coordination office of the Ansar Allah movement will also be opened in Riyadh, which will further pave the way for accepting the legitimacy of the Sanaa government and the dissolution of the resigned government in Yemen.

— The purpose of the UAE in publishing these unofficial and perhaps false news is not clear! However, these reports will only result in provoking the forces of the resigned government against Saudi Arabia and reducing the influence of the Saudi government in Yemen.

— The UAE does not have any role in the negotiations between Saudi Arabia and the Ansar Allah movement, and on the other hand, the agreement between these two parties is detrimental to the UAE’s long-term plans for the southern regions of Yemen and the islands of this country. Saudi Arabia’s reaction to these revelations could lead to further division and disagreement between them.

Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the Spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces, announced the details of the three military operations against an American ship and destroyer in the Gulf of Aden, and an Israeli ship in the Indian Ocean.

— According to the statement, the Yemeni Navy, using several naval missiles, targeted the US ship Maersk Yorktown in the Gulf of Aden.

— The Yemeni Air Force also carried out two other military operations, during one of which a US destroyer in the Gulf of Aden was targeted with several drones, and in the other operation, the Israeli ship MSC Veracruz was targeted with several drones in the Indian Ocean.

— He added at the end of the statement that the Yemeni Armed Forces, with the help of God Almighty, will continue their military actions against all hostile targets in the Red Sea, the Arab Sea, and the Indian Ocean, and in defense of Yemen and in support of the oppressed people of Palestine.

🚢 The Maersk Yorktown is a US-flagged container ship that has been active since 2004. Its port of origin and destination are listed as Djibouti, and its unclear activities suggest a connection to the Israeli regime.

🚢 The MSC Veracruz is a container ship under the flag of Madeira (an autonomous region of Portugal) that has been active since 2005. Its port of origin is Houston, the USA, and its destination is Abu Dhabi, the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

After Israeli regime’s agreement with some Arab rulers under the Abraham Accords in 2020, the relationship between the two sides have become public, and the Israeli regime is openly engaging in military contracts with Morocco. The construction of a drone production plant in Morocco is one of the latest military agreements between the two regimes that is being implemented.

— In September 2022, the Moroccan army had purchased dozens of vertical take-off WanderB and ThunderB drones from the Israeli company BlueBird Aero Systems. However, in the past few days, Ronen Nadir, the CEO of BlueBird Aero Systems, confirmed that the local drone production site has been established in Morocco over the past months and will soon begin assembling drones.

— According to the disclosed information about the military relations between Morocco and the Israeli regime, the government in Rabat has so far purchased the Barak MX defense system as well as Heron and Harop drones from Israel Aerospace Industries, plus the Skylock Counter-UAS System and the WanderB and ThunderB VTOL drones from the BlueBird Aero Systems.

— The Moroccan government has allocated a budget of over $12.88 billion to its defense industry in 2024, and based on the military cooperation agreement concluded with the Israeli regime in 2021, the Moroccan military industries will develop with the assistance of Israeli regime’s experience and experts. This signifies the increasing influence and penetration of the Israeli regime in Morocco.

— The establishment of an Israeli drone manufacturing line is also defined in this regard. This demonstrates that the Israeli regime and Morocco are rapidly expanding their military cooperation, a matter that may severely threaten the security of the countries in North and West Africa.

👉 It is worth mentioning that the Moroccan monarchy has been involved in a long-standing war with the Polisario Front over the occupation of Western Sahara for years. Moreover, Morocco’s relations with its only eastern neighbor, Algeria, are tense. Interestingly, Algeria has the clearest and most intense enmity with the Israeli regime among all Arab countries and also supports the Polisario Front in the Western Sahara conflict against Morocco. Therefore, the Israeli regime’s infiltration into Morocco is a carefully calculated and planned matter, similar to the Israeli regime’s infiltration into the Republic of Azerbaijan and what is happening the West Asian country.

The “military objective” of last night’s operation was the attack on the most important airbase of the Israeli regime, namely the Nevatim airbase near the Dimona nuclear facility!! was successfully carried out despite the presence of the most concentrated defense systems in the world, and the pre-determined airbase was hit. The Israelis must know that every point of the Israeli regime’s entity is under Iran’s control and strike, and the bluster and threats against Iran never go unanswered…

2024-04-14T18:58:38+00:00,-1001458314607,"👉 The third important point; in last night’s attack, “none” of the powerful and advanced Iranian hypersonic missiles such as the types of Fattah 1 and 2, or the Khorramshahr missile, and so on, were used. Last night’s attacks were carried out using inexpensive and cost-effective HESA Shahed 136 drones, simple cruise missiles, and low-cost liquid-propellant Rezvan missiles, which were stored in large quantities in warehouses and remained unused for a long time. In fact, these armaments were mostly used to saturate the air defense systems, and among them, a few solid-propellant missiles like Haj Qasem and Kheibar Shekan were also used for attacking and hitting the targets. The result is that if Iran’s decision was to use more advanced missiles, with this same single wave of attack, the casualties and damage to the Israeli regime would have been much greater than what we witnessed last night. 

When it comes to the financial burden and staggering costs that Israel has incurred, there are also very important points to consider. You can pay attention to the estimated figures for last night’s operations. Quoting FieldMarshal, an independent analyst of Iranian defense and industrial technologies, the approximate cost to Iran for carrying out last night’s attacks is estimated as follows: 110 ballistic missiles: $30-50 million, 45 cruise missiles: $4-7 million, and 170 Shahed drones: $4-5 million, totaling approximately $38-62 million for Iran.
On the other hand, however, the Israeli costs will be staggering: Considering an estimated number of 300-400 aircraft that were likely in operation for 4-10 hours, with an average hourly cost of $30,000 to $40,000, the cost would be $50-160 million. The cost of intercepting cruise missiles and suicide drones: $100-150 million, and the cost of intercepting ballistic missiles: $500-700 million. Taking into account the estimated damage caused by the ballistic missiles, somewhere between $100 million to $500 million, the Israeli regime has incurred a total of $750 million in the most pessimistic scenario, or $1.5 billion in the most optimistic scenario!!!

This amount of staggering cost “just for enduring one night of attack only for repelling one wave of attack” translates into the complete economic collapse of the Zionists. If the battles continue for just a few days, the economy of the Israeli regime will be completely paralyzed and destroyed! This is another clear and obvious example that the Zionists do not have the capability to engage in long-term warfare, or better yet, even short-term warfare with the Islamic Republic of Iran, and that is why they are extremely concerned about responding to Iran’s last night attacks.

👉 The fourth important point; as mentioned, Iran did not at all utilize the potential of other Axis of Resistance countries for extensive missile and drone attacks against the Zionist regime’s child-killing regime or to saturate its air defense systems in last night’s attack, and Iran alone carried out the operation. Now, imagine if attacks were carried out simultaneously and extensively from Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Yemen, and if Iran also entered the battlefield with a large number of missiles and drones in several waves of attacks; even the thought of this scenario is debilitating and very painful for the Israeli regime. In any case, this stage has currently come to an end to see what would happen later and for a rainy day!

2024-04-14T18:54:21+00:00,-1001458314607,"#Iran #Israel
There are several very important points about last night’s retaliatory attacks that need to be paid attention to: According to Western sources’ claims, Iran fired 185 drones, 110 ballistic missiles, and 110 cruise missiles towards the occupied territories in the attacks last night, and it is claimed that most of these missiles and drones have been intercepted; but the ground reality is different!

👉 The first important point; Iranian missile and drone attacks took place while the Israeli regime’s air defense network was in the most prepared state possible, and all military combat information capabilities of the regime, from defense systems to fighter jets, were 100% mobilized to counter Iran’s attacks. In addition, all military capabilities of the US and its allies, such as the treacherous country of Jordan, also came to the aid of the Israeli regime. On the other hand, all attacks were carried out from the Iranian soil, and it were coordinated with other axis of resistance countries such as Iraq and Yemen to refrain from carrying out extensive missile and drone attacks; And in fact, Iran did not use the potential of the resistance in Iraq and Yemen to saturate the enemy’s defense systems! And alone, with the launch of dozens of suicide drones and cruise missiles, it saturated the defense systems of Israel and the United States. Of course, there is an exception regarding the targets hit in the northern occupied Golan Heights, where Lebanon’s Hezbollah helped to saturate the air defense systems in this area by targeting some positions of Israel in northern occupied Palestine with its attack.

The point is that most of the cruise missiles, suicide drones, and even ballistic missiles were “fired with the aim of saturating the air defense systems,” and predetermined targets were hit by a number of other ballistic missiles that passed through the Israeli regime’s defensive barrier. This method and approach are quite common in the world for dealing with air defense systems. So, do not be deceived by the lies and false propaganda of the MSM about the lack of success and interception of all missiles and drones!

👉 The second very important point; last night’s attack “was only one wave of attack,” and the subsequent waves of breaking and destroying were not carried out! In the conventional military dimension, these types of attacks are carried out in several waves for ultimate and real effectiveness. In the final moments of last night’s attacks and as the first wave of attacks was nearing its end, the Israeli regime’s air defense systems began to experience saturation, and it was at that point that some of the ballistic missiles, by passing through the defensive barrier, hit the Nevatim and Ramon airbases. This is exactly the moment when the second, third, and subsequent waves should have been carried out for the destruction of the targets, but Iran, in the true sense of the word, “restrained” itself. The reason for this is very clear and obvious. The purpose of the “single wave” attack was to send a clear warning message to the Israeli regime, the West, and its lackeys to understand the power of Iran and to know that if the Islamic Republic of Iran wishes, it is capable of crushing its enemies and ill-wishers, and they should not mess with Iran any further!

This announcement states:

In following the strategic policies of the Islamic Republic of Iran,
👉 1- The American terrorist government is warned that any support and participation in harming Iran's interests will result in a decisive and regretful response from the armed forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran; Also, the United States is responsible for the evil actions of the Zionist regime, and if this child-killing regime is not curbed in the region, it must accept its consequences.

👉 2. While emphasizing the policy of good neighborliness with neighbors and countries in the region, we emphasize that any threat by the terrorist state of America and the Zionist regime from any country will result in a reciprocal and proportionate response from the Islamic Republic of Iran to the source of the threat. We assure the heroic nation of Iran that the IRGC and other armed forces of the country will stand to the death in defense of national interests and will neutralize the enemies' efforts to disrupt the security and peace of the people.

🔸 What is the general story so far:

➖Finally, Iran's promise came true and Israel was directly attacked. According to Western media, Iran used more than 400-500 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and suicide drones in these attacks. The flight of these weapons has been recorded in different regions of Iran and Iraq. Also, information has been published about the occurrence of an explosion on Iranian soil, which, if true, can be considered a technical defect and failure of missiles.

➖As expected, the resistance groups of Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen have also entered the field and are participating in the operations of the Iranian armed forces against Israel.

➖At first glance, the attempt of this operation is to divert the focus of Israel's defense systems, which is being carried out from several directions.

➖Due to Israel's strict control over the Zionist media, no video or image of hitting or confronting Iranian drones and missiles has been published. Even the siren notification media has been deactivated in the occupied territories.

➖American and British fighter jets have entered the Syrian sky to counter the Iranian drones.

➖The Syrian army air defenses are on alert and has left its skies and airports open for Iranian planes.

➖A massive cyber and hacking attack is underway targeting Israeli systems.

👉 It seems that the conflict will continue until this morning and we will get more details about the results of Iran's operations in the coming hours. Stay with us...

The name of the deceased individual has not been disclosed, but it is said that this individual had been a member of USAID for over two decades and were on a mission on the southwestern coast and Gaza.

Given this person’s long-term background, and USAID’s inappropriate track record in various fields, as well as its activities such as espionage, nation-building, and so on, it is likely that this was not a usual killing, but rather an operation aimed at the physical elimination of this individual by elements associated with the enemies of the Israeli regime, especially the Palestinian resistance.

It is worth mentioning that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was established in 1961 by integrating other American institutions involved in international development, and is currently active in over 100 countries worldwide, including Jordan, the Republic of Azerbaijan, Afghanistan (prior to the Taliban’s takeover), and Iraq.

The Alsace frigate of the French army retreated from the waters of Yemen towards the Suez Canal after the first confrontation with missile and drone attacks by the Yemeni Armed Forces in the Red Sea.  

Commander of the Alsace frigate said in an interview with the French newspaper Le Figaro about the reasons for this retreat: The withdrawal of our warship is due to the high level of threats from the Houthis (the Ansar Allah movement).

He also emphasized that the French frigate used all its military equipment from a two-million-dollar Aster missile to a machine gun during its confrontation with Ansar Allah’s attacks.

The French Navy, following the European Union’s decision to deploy military fleets to the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden in February 2023, sent two Alsace and Languedoc warships to the waters near Yemen. The Alsace frigate is equipped with an air defense system, and the Languedoc is an anti-submarine warfare frigate.  

The French army claims that during this period, the Languedoc warfare frigate shot down two suicide drones, and the Alsace warship destroyed three ballistic missiles from the Ansar Allah movement in the course of two operations in the Red Sea. The Alsace warship is the second European warship to leave the Red Sea and retreat after the Danish warship Iver Huitfeldt frigate.

U.S. intelligence suggests that the potential Iranian response could involve over 100 drones and dozens of missiles aimed at Israeli military installations. 

According to two U.S. officials, defending against such a large-scale attack would pose a significant challenge for Israel. While there is a chance Iran might choose a less severe attack to prevent further escalation, the retaliation is considered imminent.

Iran's threat to respond to the targeting of its consulate in Syria has made Israel paralyzed by fear. This is part of today's Israeli media reports about the tense situation in occupied Palestine.

These media announced that the Israeli army has raised the alert level and regular and reserve soldiers from some special units who were planning to travel received a travel cancellation notice. This new order follows the fear of these soldiers being targeted outside the occupied Palestinian territories.

The Israeli regime has closed 28 of its political offices in the world for fear of Iran's punitive response. This regime has also jammed the GPS system in order to disrupt possible attacks and has canceled the leave of its soldiers in combat units.

On the other hand, many Israelis have rushed to the stores to buy essential items and food. This caused some Zionist officials to ask the Israelis to keep calm.

It should be noted that since about 40 days ago, with the aim of reducing the tensions, rocket, missile and drone attacks against American bases in Iraq and Syria had been halted. It seems that the recent crime of the Israeli regime and the attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus has once again led the resistance groups to this conclusion to attack the US military bases, which supports the Israeli regime, with rocket and drone attacks.

👉 Rocket, missile and drone attacks on American bases in Iraq and Syria can be expensive for Americans! In the latest of these cases, on January 28, three American soldiers were killed and 40 others were injured following a drone attack on the US army base in al-Tanf region, located on the border of Syria and Jordan. If Israel’s aggression continues, these incidents may happen again and the Americans will lose more forces!

– Former US President Donald Trump has repeatedly stated that he is willing to negotiate with Iran on various issues, but the Islamic Republic did not fall for the United States’ deception. Iran never negotiates with the US on regional issues, and if it wants to negotiate, it does so openly.

– Iran has been a real supporter of all those fighting the Israeli regime from the beginning (the victory of the Islamic Revolution in 1979) to the present, and with this support, it has changed many equations and defeated many enemy plans.

– The relationship and friendship with Iran are a source of honor, dignity, and human dignity in this era and there is no shame in it. Those who should be ashamed are those who have relations with the Israeli regime and support them.

– Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu must be stopped in the final stage of this war on the Gaza Strip and accept his defeat. The Zionists do not have the power to defeat the Palestinian resistance movement, Hamas, and other resistance factions after six months and cannot free their prisoners and even have no plan for after the war.

– US President Joe Biden has told Netanyahu that you have lost your friends and need to reconsider your relationships and behavior.

– The US and the Israeli regime have exerted great pressure and threatened to close other fronts, including missile attacks from Lebanon, but have not succeeded.

– The axis of resistance is moving towards a historic and great victory in this battle and only needs time in this regard.

– Iran’s response to the attack on the Iranian consulate in Damascus will take place, and there is no doubt about it. The Israeli regime is also confident and has taken special measures in the occupied territories and has called up all its reserve forces. Now Iran decides when time is ripe to carry out this response. We do not know the time of this attack and do not interfere in it, but all Iranians have the same opinion about this decision.

– Another point is how the Israeli regime will respond to this retaliatory operation by the Iranians, so we must be prepared for all scenarios, and God willing, Netanyahu’s foolishness in attacking the Iranian consulate in Damascus will lead to the ending to these attacks and wars.

– The resistance in Lebanon is not afraid of war and has managed its battle over the past six months and has a comprehensive strategy in the battle that will lead to military, spiritual, and political victory. We have not yet used our main weapons, and everyone knows this. Some 250,000 Zionists in the north of the occupied territories of Palestine have become refugees, and these events have occurred with the least weapons we have used. If they initiate a war, we embrace it. The resistance never fears war, because it possesses the required power, unification, and facilities.

▫️In past years' exercises, including the Great Prophet 17 exercise, the IRGC's aerospace force has simulated and practiced missile and drone attacks on Israeli positions many times and it is highly likely that one of these operations will be carried out in the form of these exercises.

▫️In these retaliatory operations, the IRGC can carry out a combined precision strikes on the Israeli regime's air bases, air defense systems, weapon depots and other military facilities using Fattah, Khaybar Shekan, Fateh series and Paveh missiles, as well as the deadly Shahed-136 suicide drones.

The short statement published in this regard is as follows:

✍️ “In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful
The brave and devoted general of Islam, Major General Mohammad Reza Zahedi, along with his honorable comrade General Mohammad Hadi Haji Rahimi, were martyred by the crime of the usurping and hateful Zionist regime. May the peace and mercy of God and his saints be upon them and the other martyrs of this incident, and curses upon the leaders of the oppressive and aggressor regime.
Our martyrs received the sign of acceptance of their long-term endeavour from their merciful God, and now they are blessed with God’s grace in the company of saints and righteous.
General Zahedi was waiting for martyrdom in the Jihad fields decades ago. They did not lose anything and received their reward, but the grief of their loss is heavy for the Iranian nation, especially for those who knew them.
The evil regime will be punished by the hands of our brave men. We will make them regret this crime and other crimes like this by God’s will.”

✍️ Israel’s attacks on the south and other areas of Lebanon have increased after the fruitless visit of Amos Hochstein, the special adviser and special envoy of the US President in Lebanon to Beirut, and recent Israeli attacks are not a new issue.

▪️ I say to the Zionists, do not be happy about the crimes, because they will take you faster to the path of certain death and take you out of the Palestinian land.

▪️ (Addressing the US) The era of control, colonization and enslavement of people through genocide has passed and ended, and your loss in this battle is heavy. If you overdo it, the consequences will be bigger and more dangerous, and your army under your protection “Israel” will be exposed to a historical disgrace. You will inherit disappointment and failure from Britain.

▪️ Americans and Israelis are coordinating on the ground to kill refugees who go to get help. The Israeli enemy puts the Gaza refugees between the options of death by starvation, murder or epidemics. The Israeli enemy has returned to create disaster in the vicinity of Al-Shifa Medical Complex.

▪️ Hezbollah’s operations had a significant impact on the enemy’s factories in the north of occupied Palestine (and the economy of the Israeli regime).

▪️ So far, 86 ships have been targeted (by the Yemeni army), which is an important, large and impressive number, and (also) Umm al-Rashrash (and the occupied Palestinian territories) have been targeted many times with cruise missiles.

▪️ The British are the followers and servants of the Americans and are in a bad situation. If the Americans and the British want to engage in a ground attack on Yemen, they must imagine themselves in front of hundreds of thousands of Yemeni heroes.

▪️ British naval commanders admit that they are facing missiles that are launched from Yemen at a speed more than 3 times the speed of sound. British naval commanders tacitly admit their inability to shoot down the missiles or prevent their arrival. British naval commanders say the pace of operations in the Red Sea is difficult and the level of concentration is exhausting.

▪️ The Americans are moving to continue invading our country and their attacks reached 13 attacks and naval bombardments this week. The enemy’s attacks this week have failed like previous attacks and cannot limit the capability of our armed forces.

▪️ Some countries coordinate with the Israeli enemy in the media and some normalization activities. If we do not carry the banner of Jihad against the atrocities of Israel, America and England, with whom and when will we fight?!

🔰US-UK Coalition Fighter Jets Conduct Air Strikes On Sanaa

▪️US-UK coalition fighter jets attacked the Yemeni capital Sanaa in a pre-dawn operation on Saturday, March 23.

The US-UK coalition fighter jet attacks on the capital of Yemen include the following cases:
➖ Four air strikes on the Attan area in Al Wahda district.
➖ Two air strikes on the al-Nahdain area in As Sabʿain district.
➖ Three air strikes on the Jarban area in Sanhan district.

The US-UK coalition fighter jets had also carried out two air strikes on the Sardoud farm in the Al Kadn area in the Al-Zahra district on Friday (March 22).

▪️The terrorist army of the United States Central Command in West Asia (CENTCOM) issued a statement, announcing that between 4:22 and 23:10 on March 22 (Sanaa time), US forces successfully destroyed four suicide drones. Additionally, the Ansar Allah movement fired four anti-ship ballistic missiles towards the Red Sea, but these attacks did not cause any casualties or damage to US, coalition, or commercial ships.

▪️CENTCOM also claimed that American forces destroyed three underground Ansar Allah warehouses in Yemen during their so-called defensive attacks. The mentioned attacks in the US statement likely refer to the air strikes carried out in Sanaa last night.

▫️The US army claims that Ansar Allah’s attacks have disrupted international shipping, but the Yemeni Salvation Government recently emphasized in a statement that over 4,500 ships have crossed the Red Sea in the past three months!

▫️Therefore, the US claim is proved to be incorrect, and the air strikes against Yemen are merely a series of actions in support of Israeli shipping. Although Ansar Allah’s missile and drone attacks do not divert ships back towards Israeli ports, they have significantly reduced ship movements towards occupied Palestine and caused notable damage to the Israeli regime’s ports and companies.

2024-03-24T11:00:49+00:00,-1001458314607,"🇺🇸🇨🇳 Who Is REALLY behind the TikTok ban? (🇮🇱)

TikTok has 103 million monthly active users in the US.

More than 1/3 (37.36%) of mobile internet users actively engage with TikTok.

Half of TikTok’s US users are between the age of 10 and 29, with teens making up the bulk of the user base.

Over 50% of content creators are between 18 and 24 years old.

From October 23-30, 2023, posts with the # ‘standwithPalestine’ were posted 10x more than posts with the # ‘standwithIsrael’.

Posts with the # ‘standwithPalestine’ also received 5x as many views.

When TikTok was accused of deliberately pushing Pro-Palestinian content, they denied the claim and made it clear that the algorithm pushes whatever people engage with.

Jonathan Greenblatt, the director of the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which is an extremely powerful Jewish-Zionist organization that has often targeted free speech, was very worried by this.

Seeing Gen Z in the US overwhelmingly support Palestine in the face of Israeli aggression, TERRIFIED him.

Is it such a coincidence that today the ‘TikTok Ban Bill’ passes after MONTHS of congress pushing for it so heavily?

They are demanding that the Chinese company ‘ByteDance’ sell the platform if the app wants to remain in the US.

With the ADL being so entangled with this decision, I would imagine they’d want to manipulate the algorithm to push Pro-Israeli content while halting Pro-Palestinian content.

The Chinese lobby isn’t a lobby Americans should be worried about, it’s the Zionist one.

Because the Zionist lobby has been altering US domestic and foreign policy for over half a century.

💥The Yemeni Navy targeted the Israeli ship Pacific-01 in the Red Sea with a number of missiles. Additionally, Yemeni drone forces conducted suicide drone attacks against an American destroyer in the Red Sea.

📊 The Yemeni military operation against the Pacific-01 ship marks the 49th strike by Yemen as well as the 50th operation against the American destroyers in the Red Sea.

▪️The Pacific-01 is a bulk carrier that has been operating under the flag of Vietnam since 2001. The origin and destination of the ship have been mentioned in ship tracking websites and marine radars as one of the ports in Vietnam, but this information is incorrect and the likely destination of this ship has been one of the occupied ports in Palestine.

👉 Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the official spokesperson for the Yemeni Armed Forces, deemed these attacks as part of executing the orders of Sayyid Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi to support the people of Palestine who are subjected to oppression, attacks, and siege in the Gaza Strip. He added that the Yemeni armed forces will expand the scope of their military operations against Israeli ships and vessels related to the occupying regime, or heading to the occupied ports of Palestine, to the Indian Ocean and the Bab al-Mandab Strait.

To this end, the Yemeni armed forces have warned all Israeli ships heading towards or departing from the ports of occupied Palestine not to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait, otherwise they will become one of the legitimate targets of the Yemeni armed forces.

Brigadier General Yahya Saree also emphasized that they will not allow Israeli vessels and any ship traveling through the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea, and the Indian Ocean towards the occupied ports of Palestine unless the attacks on their Palestinian resistance brothers are stropped and the siege of the Gaza Strip is lifted.

It is likely that the missile newly test-fired by the Ansar Allah movement, which was mentioned in the RIA Novosti report, is related to the Hatem-1 missile.

▫️The Ansar Allah movement has not yet released detailed information on the specifications of the Hatem-1 missile, but based on the specifications of the Kheibar Shekan missile, it can be said that this missile is capable of performing complex and rapid maneuvers, enabling more effective penetration of air defense systems such as the David’s Sling and Patriot missile defense systems.

🔰Baghdad Demands Precise Information About Presence Of Mossad In Iraq: National Security Advisor

▪️The National Security Advisor of Iraq referred to the recent missile attack by Iranian armed forces on Erbil city of Kurdistan province, stating that he does not deny the activities of foreign individuals affiliated with the Israeli intelligence agency, Mossad, in the city.

▫️Iraq’s National Security Advisor Qasim Mohammad Jalal al-Araji, in an interview with Al-Ahed Network, mentioned witnessing the recent attack by Iranian armed forces on a Mossad headquarters in Erbil and revealed that a Christian Iraqi citizen was present at a gathering in that house.

▫️Al-Araj stated: My emphasis is that the target point in the Erbil bombing by Iran was not a Mossad center, which does not mean that Mossad is not present in Erbil, and I do not deny that individuals with foreign affiliations are working for Mossad in the region. Masoud Barzani gave me full authority to inspect any suspicious points suspected of Mossad elements, and Iraq is seeking to obtain precise information about the presence of Mossad elements on its soil.

▫️The National Security Advisor of Iraq concluded by adding: A comprehensive report on the Erbil bombing has been submitted to the Prime Minister [of Iraq Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani]. Let us not forget that Iran was the first country to assist Iraq in all difficult circumstances and provided weapons to Iraq in the fight against ISIS.

👉 The statements of the National Security Advisor of Iraq regarding the presence of Mossad in Iraqi Kurdistan region come at a time when recently Nechervan Idris Barzani, the President of the Kurdistan region of Iraq, in an interview with Al Arabiya and Al-Hadath media outlets, denied any relations between the Kurdistan region and the Israeli regime and claimed that the Kurdistan Region does not have any ties with the regime and there is no Mossad base in Iraqi Kurdistan.

👉 Therefore, based on the statements of the National Security Advisor of Iraq and his confirmation of the presence of Mossad in Iraqi Kurdistan, it can be said that Iran’s claims about the presence of Mossad forces in the Iraqi region were entirely accurate. It is worth noting that in recent years, Western intelligence services led by the US and specifically the Mossad of the Israeli regime have significantly increased anti-security operations against Iran in Kurdistan region of Iraq and, under the guise of Kurdish separatist groups, carry out terrorist operations within Iran.

▫️In addition to military casualties, the military operations of the Yemeni armed forces against the Israeli regime have put significant economic pressure on this regime. Therefore, due to pressure from Israeli lobbies around the world, US and UK military fleets have been stationed in the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea to defend Israel entity and interests, and are now conducting daily airstrikes against various areas in Yemen. Nevertheless, these coalition attacks on Yemen have not only failed to suppress the Yemeni army and Ansar Allah movement but have also increased the demands of the Yemeni people to stand against attacks and escalate tensions in the region.

🔰Ground Clashes In Southern Lebanon; Hezbollah Thwarts Israeli Army Infiltration Into Lebanese Territory

▪️Forces of the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah last night and this morning thwarted the military incursion of Israeli soldiers in two axes, Ramieh and Rmaych, located in southern Lebanon.

▫️Hezbollah’s different statements regarding this clash are as follows:
- Hezbollah forces, at 11:45 PM last night (local time), launched a rocket attack on Israeli soldiers who were attempting to infiltrate the Rmaych area in Lebanese territory from the Wadi Qatmoun area.
- Hezbollah forces, at 12:15 AM Monday, attacked Golani Brigade soldiers of the Israeli regime’s army by detonating a roadside bomb at the Khirbet Ziraat border across from the village of Ramieh, followed by artillery attacks against the Israelis.
- Hezbollah forces, at 1:30 AM Monday, targeted the Ziraat base and its surroundings with artillery fire.

After the special forces of the Israeli army’s failed attempt to carry out a security operation in the town of Ayta ash Shab on January 16, last night’s clash is considered the second attempt by Israeli forces to infiltrate Lebanese territory.

Israeli authorities have repeatedly threatened that if Hezbollah does not withdraw from southern Lebanese areas, they will launch a ground attack on areas south of the Litani River.

The possibility of an Israeli ground attack on Lebanon has been raised as a threat since the 2006 war but has never taken place for various reasons.

Overall, the continuation of conflict and intensified Israeli attacks in the Gaza Strip and deep into Lebanese territory could escalate into a broader conflict on this front.

▫️Previous rounds of ceasefire negotiations between the Israeli regime and Hamas, which were mediated by Egypt and the United States, did not reach a conclusion due to differences over the duration of the ceasefire and the number of prisoners who should be released.

▫️Hamas demands a complete cessation of the war, a complete retreat of the Israeli regime’s army from the Gaza Strip, and the return of refugees to their homes in the besieged area, while the Israeli army considers these terms to be contrary to its objectives and the acceptance of their defeat in the face of Palestinian resistance.

▪️On the other hand, the Israeli command, in an unsuccessful attempt, provided explanations to hide this crime and distort the reality. According to Israeli regime officials, Palestinians attacked arriving trucks with humanitarian aid, and several people were injured as a result of the stampede. Later, some of the Palestinians approached the Israeli tank, as a result of which Israeli soldiers fired warning shots into the air, and only then shot at the legs! The Israeli regime claim that most of the victims and deaths are allegedly associated with the actions of certain individuals who drove into the crowds of gathered residents.

▪️Residents of the southern regions of Lebanon have reported numerous flights of Israeli fighter jets and drones over the cities of Nabatieh, Tire and other southern towns of Lebanon. The sound of the explosion in the sky of Tire and Nabatieh (video) is related to the breaking of the sound barrier by Israeli fighter jets; And the areas of Beit Leif and Ramieh have been bombed by the Israeli regime.

👉 Also, a few minutes ago, a report was published about the shooting down of an Israeli reconnaissance drone in the sky of Labouneh area. Hezbollah has not published a statement about this incident; And no pictures have been published in this regard so far.

🔰 Hamas Received The Draft Proposal Of Paris Talks

▫️Hamas has received a draft proposal from Gaza truce talks in Paris for a pause in military operations and the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages.

Based on this draft, all military operations will be stopped for 40 days and for every Zionist prisoner in Gaza, 10 Palestinian prisoners will be exchanged. Hospitals and bakeries are being repaired in Gaza.

According to Reuters, the proposed plans include:
▪️Both parties stop their military operations completely.
▪️Aerial reconnaissance operations over Gaza will stop for eight hours a day.
▪️All Israeli hostages, including women, children under 19 years of age, the elderly aged 50 years and above, and the sick, must be released in exchange for a specific number of Palestinian prisoners according to the numbers listed below.
▪️In exchange for the 40 hostages listed under the humanitarian category, approximately 400 Palestinian prisoners will be released, according to the ratio of 10 prisoners to one hostage.
▪️Gradual return of all displaced civilians – except men of military service age – to the northern Gaza Strip.
▪️After commencing the first phase, Israel will reposition its forces away from densely populated areas in the Gaza Strip.
▪️Commitment to bring in 500 trucks per day of humanitarian aid.
▪️Commitment to providing 200,000 tents and 60,000 caravans.
▪️Allowing the rehabilitation of hospitals and bakeries in Gaza, including immediately allowing the entry of necessary equipment and providing shipments of fuel for these purposes, according to quantities to be agreed upon.
▪️Israel agrees to the entry of heavy machinery and equipment to remove rubble and assist with other humanitarian purposes, with the provision of fuel shipments necessary for these purposes, according to quantities to be agreed upon, provided that they increase over time. Hamas pledges not to use these machines and equipment to threaten Israel.
▪️It is understood that the arrangements agreed in the first phase will not apply to the second phase, which will be subject to subsequent separate negotiations.

In this regard, the American media Axios announced that the Hamas movement is discouraged from the new proposals to reach a ceasefire agreement and the exchange of prisoners in the current battle, and there are still wide differences between them and the Zionist regime. There is no room for optimism and at the current stage, it is difficult to imagine an agreement between Israel and Hamas before Ramadan.

It is worth mentioning that during the last four months, high-level talks were held between the American, Qatari and Israeli delegations to stop the war, but these meetings did not have any specific results; And so far, efforts to establish a ceasefire and exchange prisoners between Hamas and the Israeli regime have been unsuccessful.

▪️During a visit to the Northern Command headquarters in Safed, the Minister of War of the Israeli regime Yoav Gallant stated that even if an agreement is reached with the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas regarding a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and the release of prisoners, military operations against the Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah will continue. 

Yoav Gallant also threatened to continue bombing positions of the Hezbollah in Lebanon until their objectives are achieved. He had previously promised to eliminate Hezbollah from the Litani River in southern Lebanon, either through a political agreement or through military action.

So far, in the exchange of fire between the Israeli regime and Hezbollah, more than 205 Lebanese fighters have been killed and several others injured. On the other side, significant human casualties have been inflicted upon the Israeli regime, but it refrains from disclosing its actual losses.

📊 It is worth mentioning that during Hezbollah’s attacks on Israeli positions, two Iron Dome systems, at least 28 soldiers, 25 tanks, and 4 logistic vehicles have been targeted and destroyed.

✍️ In recent days, the Israeli regime has intensified its attacks on the Lebanese resistance movement in comparison with previous weeks. The nature of the attacks and the position of Israeli authorities indicate their aim to maximize gains from the conflicts in northern occupied territories of Palestine. Therefore, it can be said that the war in northern Israeli-occupied territories and southern Lebanon is like a double-edged sword, which has put pressure on the Israeli regime but could also have the opposite result. The management of the battlefield and timely implementation of counter-tactics will play a key role in the future success or failure of the Lebanese resistance movement in these conflicts in the war zone.

🔸 “The Islamic resistance [in Iraq] continues to attack Zionist targets, and this resistance has played an important role since the beginning of the battle ""Al-Aqsa Storm"".

🔸 The current calm is a temporary tactic for redeployment, as some traitors and agents sold their patriotism and religion to the occupier and provided him with information about the resistance and its whereabouts. Therefore, there was a need to change the methods of combat.

🔸 There is high coordination between the Axis [resistance] fronts, and any lull on one front and revival on the other is a well-thought-out strategy.

🔰Yemen Army Carries Out Fresh Missile, Drone Attack Against US Ships

The naval and air forces of the Yemeni army, in a joint military operation, attacked the US ship Torm Thor in the Gulf of Aden with several ballistic anti-ship missiles and used several suicide drones to attack the US military fleet in the Red Sea.

According to a statement from the US Central Command in West Asia (CENTCOM), at 17:00 Sana’a time on Saturday (February 24) the USS Mason destroyer intercepted a ballistic anti-ship missile launched from areas under the control of the Ansar Allah movement in Yemen towards the Gulf of Aden.

This missile most likely targeted the Torm Thor tanker carrying chemical/oil materials under the US flag. CENTCOM claims that neither the tanker nor the US destroyer were harmed in this attack.

The Torm Thor ship is a tanker carrying chemical and oil materials that has been operating under the US flag since 2015. The ship was last located off the coast of Djibouti, and detailed information about its exact origin and destination is not available.

Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman for the Yemeni armed forces, described this operation as part of their mission to defend the land and people of Yemen, emphasizing that Yemeni forces will carry out high-quality military operations against all hostile targets in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea.

He also added that alongside all the great people of Yemen, the Yemeni armed forces will continue their religious, moral, and humanitarian duties concerning the people of Palestine, and that their military operations will not stop until the end of the aggressions against and siege of the Palestinian people living in the Gaza Strip.

Peter Stano, Lead Spokesperson for foreign affairs and security policy of the European Union, confirmed that the EU naval military mission in the Red Sea, under the name of Operation EUNAVFOR ASPIDES, has commenced.

He stated the aim of implementing this operation an attempt to restore security and maintain freedom of navigation in the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. It was emphasized that the nature of this operation is purely defensive, and the EU forces will have the capability to destroy missiles targeting commercial ships.

▫️The EU’s deployment of military forces to the Red Sea is seen as a response to the successful naval operations by Yemeni armed forces in support of Palestine and the unsuccessful US-led coalition efforts to deter attacks on ships associated with Israel, the United States, and the United Kingdom.

▫️Analysts and critics in Europe believe that the EU’s operation in the international waters of the Red Sea to the Gulf of Persia will not have any particular impact, as the EU lacks the equipped military and naval capabilities that the US military possesses to effectively carry out such maritime operations in the Red Sea to achieve the aforementioned objectives.

🔰 Will Rafah City Witness Extensive Israeli Incursion?

▪️In recent days, the issue of the extensive attack by the Israeli regime’s army on Rafah city of the Gaza Strip and the related comments have become a hot topic in regional and international media outlets, raising the question of whether the Israeli army will initiate extensive operations against the Palestinian city.

▫️Recent statements by Israeli officials about a widespread attack on Rafah have drawn reactions from human rights organizations and countries within the international community. These statements were made while this region is hosting over one and a half million Palestinian refugees from the northern and central areas of the Gaza Strip.

▪️After the Israeli regime’s plan to attack Rafah strengthened in recent days, the quality of Hezbollah’s attacks increased compared to its strikes in recent weeks. In addition to Lebanon’s Hezbollah, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq also carried out a new drone attack against Israeli military positions in the occupied Golan Heights after several days of cessation of strikes.

▫️Given these actions, it seems that the plan for escalating battles in northern occupied Palestine and putting the Israeli officials in a state of uncertainty and anticipation, the Iraqi resistance’s attack on the occupied Golan, anti-Zionist operations in Kiryat Malakhi, and the direct operations of the Yemeni army against US and UK ships in the Red Sea are part of a warning from the resistance axis towards aggression against Rafah. The potential all-out Israeli attack on Rafah will also elevate the level of actions by members of the resistance axis.

▪️The plan for an extensive attack on Rafah city was met with strong opposition from Israeli settlers until the release of two Israeli captives by the regime’s military somewhat shifted the balance in favor of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. This action to some extent reduced pressures on his cabinet regarding the achievements of the ongoing genocidal war on the Gaza Strip.

▫️The release of prisoners provided Netanyahu and his allies with the opportunity to present Rafah as a key to achieving their goals by justifying the continuation of war and using it as a pressure tool on some members of Israel’s war cabinet, especially Cabinet Minister Benny Gantz. Furthermore, after the release of Israeli captives in Rafah city, unity within the regime’s war cabinet increased for an attack on Rafah to some extent.

▪️Analyses indicate that the Israeli regime is buying time to prepare for an extensive attack on Rafah city, and if the regime carries out the project, considering the presence of a large number of Palestinian refugees, it will lead to a major humanitarian disaster. Taking these factors into account and overall assessments, it is necessary for the resistance axis to increase the quality and quantity of attacks against the Israeli regime with the aim of exerting pressure on Netanyahu’s cabinet so that these attacks have an impact on the decision-making process and future strategies of this regime regarding extensive strikes on Rafah city.

🔰 Extensive attacks by the Yemeni armed forces on the positions of Israel and the American coalition in the Red Sea

▫️Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces, announced a large-scale missile and drone attack against American and Israeli warships.

✍️ Brigadier General Yahya Saree announced by publishing a statement: “The Yemeni Air Force carried out military operations with a number of suicide drones against a number of US enemy warships in the Red and Arabian seas. In addition, another operation was carried out to target the sensitive points of the Israeli enemy in the area of Um al-Rashrash (Eilat) in the south of occupied Palestine with a number of drones. Also, the Navy of the Yemeni Armed Forces has targeted an Israeli ship MSC SILVER in the Gulf of Aden with a number of naval missiles. This operation is a victory for the oppressed people of Palestine who are under attack and siege until this moment. These attacks are also a response to the US and British aggression in Yemen.”

📊 According to IWN’s assessment, Ansar Allah’s operation against the MSC Silver ship is the 36th operation and the attack on the American coalition military fleet is the 37th operation by Yemeni forces against Israeli, American, British and vessels affiliated with them in the Red Sea and Arabian Sea. Also, the drone attack on Eilat is the 15th missile and drone operation of the Yemeni army against Israeli positions in the occupied Palestine.

👉 So far, the US and British military aggression against Yemeni forces did not lead to the stated goal. On the contrary, it only escalated the tensions and the foreign intervention severed the situation in the Red Sea.
Now, the Yemeni army actually managed to block one of the main sea routes on the planet, And if the aggression of America and its allies in the Red Sea and the Gaza Strip does not end; there is no bright future for them in the southern waters…

🔰 Russian Army Captures Important Ukraine Town Avdiivka (Map)

▪️On February 17, Ukraine’s armed forces announced the retreat of Ukrainian military forces from the town of Avdiivka in the north of Donetsk city in a statement, and Russian army forces entered various areas of the town, gaining complete control of Avdiivka.

▫️Following the failure of Ukrainian army’s offensive operations in various fronts in the past year and the weakening of the Ukrainian army due to various reasons such as the high number of human casualties, lack of necessary logistics to overcome Russian military power, and the beginning of the war in Gaza which diverted most attention to Palestine, Russian forces intensified operations on the Avdiivka front once again.

▫️Over the past four months, Russian and Donetsk (DPR) forces gradually besieged the town of Avdiivka through a series of continuous and coordinated operations from the north and south.

▫️On January 20th, Russian forces managed to break through Avdiivka’s defensive lines from the south and entered urban areas. In further battles, on February 3, Russian army forces also broke Ukrainian defense lines from the north and entered the northern areas of Avdiivka, practically cutting off all main supply and support lines for Ukrainian forces in Avdiivka, leaving only the western areas of the city for retreat. Therefore, Ukrainian armed forces began gradually retreating from Avdiivka from February 4, and finally on February 17, they announced a complete withdrawal from the town of Avdiivka in a statement.

👉 According to the Russian Ministry of Defense, the area that came under Russian army’s control during the Avdiivka operation is over 31.75 square kilometers. It can boldly be stated that the Russian army’s control over the town of Avdiivka is Russia’s most significant victory in the Ukraine war after the occupation of the city of Bakhmut in 2023.

✍️ The important town of Avdiivka was considered one of the strongest defense and military lines of the Ukrainian army in the north of Donetsk city. Previously, Ukrainian army’s control over this town was the main obstacle to the expansion of Russian military operations in the Donbass region. Now, with the occupation of Avdiivka by Russia and its allies, the security of Donetsk city from the north has been significantly ensured, and the Russian army finds the opportunity to expand battle lines around Donetsk city with more concentration and power.

🔰 Yemeni Army Shoots Down United States MQ-9 Drone

💥 Last night, on February 18, the air defense of the Yemeni army has successfully destroyed a United States MQ-9 drone in the sky over the northern governorate of Al Hudaydah by firing a surface-to-air missile.

▫️According to Brigadier General Yahya Sare, spokesperson for the Yemeni armed forces, this drone was engaged in operations in support of the Israeli regime in the Yemeni sky when it was attacked and accurately hit by the Yemeni army’s air defense forces.

▪️It is worth mentioning that the Yemeni army’s air defense also successfully destroyed another group of MQ-9 drones over the Red Sea on November 8, 2023.

The latest attack is considered the sixth successful operation by the Ansar Allah movement against MQ-9 drones in recent years, and previously, five groups of MQ-9 drones had been destroyed in the skies over the Yemeni governorates of Sanaa, Al Hudaydah, Dhamar, Marib, as well as the Red Sea.

🚢💥 Yemeni Army Missiles Set UK-linked Vessel On Fire!

▪️Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces, confirmed the news about the heavy missile attack on a British-linked ship ‘Rubymar’ and the stoppage of this ship in the Gulf of Aden.

Earlier, the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) also reported a missile attack 35 kilometers south of the port of Al-Mokha (Mocha) near the Bab al-Mandab Strait.

💥💥According to the report, the Rubymar ship was passing from the port of Khor Fakkan city in the east of the UAE to a so-called destination in Bulgaria through the Red Sea when it was hit in a heavy ballistic missile attack by the Yemeni army. Following the operation, the ship suffered a serious fire and the crew, unable to extinguish it, evacuated the ship.

▫️According to the statement of Brigadier General Yahya Saari, the British ship stopped completely after being hit and was in danger of sinking as a result of major damage. He also emphasized that during the operation, we made sure that the ship’s crew got out of this ship safely.

🚢 Rubymar is a bulk carrier that has been operating under the flag of Belize, a small country in Central America since 1997.

It appears that in line with the ongoing military operations of the Israeli regime’s army in the Gaza Strip and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s determination to attack Rafah city, the military equation in Yemen is also changing. It is worth mentioning that the Yemeni armed forces had previously declared the passage of Israeli, American, British ships, as well as vessels affiliated with them through the Red Sea route forbidden until a complete cessation of war in Gaza.

🔰 Israel Kicks Off Extensive Attacks on Southern Lebanon

▪️The Israeli regime’s army air force announced the start of the first wave of extensive airstrikes on southern Lebanon in a short message.

These attacks began following Hezbollah’s rocket attack on the city of Safed on Wednesday, resulting in Israeli fighter jets bombing the city of Nabatieh and the areas of Odaisseh, Al-Shahabiya, as-Sawahira, Al-Jabour Heights, Labouneh, and several other points in southern Lebanon.

As a result of the Israeli airstrike on Odaisseh, at least four people, including a woman and a child, were martyred, and nine others were injured. The Israeli airstrike on the city of Nabatieh resulted in the martyrdom of 11 people and left more than 12 others wounded.

The Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah has not issued an official statement in response to these attacks yet, and some Lebanese media outlets have quoted Hashim Safi Al Din, Head of the Executive Council of Hezbollah, as saying that Israel’s attacks against civilians will not go unanswered.

The Israeli army’s airstrikes on southern Lebanon intensify and expand at the time, when this regime’s ground operation in the city of Rafah in southern Gaza also began. Indeed, the Israeli regime’s attack on Rafah marks another round of confrontations between the resistance front and this regime and will undoubtedly lead to intensified attacks and increased pressure from other resistance groups in Lebanon, Yemen, and Iraq.

- Rocket attack on the gathering of Israeli soldiers in Mitzpeh Adi (Hunin) outpost.
- Artillery attack on spying equipment in Hadab Yarin base.
- Artillery attack on the Israeli police building in Kiryat Shemona.

▫️Hezbollah's attack on Kiryat Shemona has led to power outages in several parts of this town and a number of Zionists were wounded. According to field investigations, the Kiryat Shemona police center was training the Zionists for the scenario of a large-scale war with Hezbollah in recent days. Therefore, Hezbollah's attack on this center can be seen as a serious response and warning to Israel's recent belligerence.

🔰 Escalation Of Conflict Between Hezbollah, Israeli Army In Southern Lebanon, A War Is Coming?!

▪️On Friday, the Israeli regime’s fighter jets and drones bombed an uninhabited building at the intersection of Harouf, Jebshit and Al- Doueir on the outskirts of the western city of Nabatieh in southern Lebanon after carrying out eight airstrikes in the areas of Maroun al-Ras, Kfar Tebnit, Al- Khiam, Al-Naqoura, Ayta ash Shab, Markaba, and Yuhmor al-Shaqif. According to local sources, the latest bombardment did not result in any casualties.

▫️In response to these attacks, Lebanese resistance movement Hezbollah conducted seven attacks against Israeli positions on the occupied northern borders of Palestine, firing a large number of Katyusha rockets towards the Kila military base in the occupied Golan Heights, located 10 kilometers far from the Lebanese border. The Iron Dome defense system of the Israeli regime’s army intercepted most of these rockets, and details of their impact have not been disclosed.

▪️With the recent escalation of Israeli airstrikes in southern Lebanon, Hezbollah has also increased its rocket attacks within a 10-kilometer range of the occupied northern borders of Palestine. The surge of Israeli airstrikes and the failure of US officials’ negotiations with the Lebanese government to force Hezbollah resistance movement to retreat from the southern Lebanese borders have increased the likelihood of escalation of war on the southern Lebanon-northern Palestine front.

▫️Previously, Commander of the Israeli Air Force Aluf Tomer Bar had announced readiness of the Israeli forces to carry out a widespread attack on Lebanon, stating: Tens of Israeli aircraft are stationed in Lebanon’s airspace and the number of these aircraft can reach hundreds if necessary. We will attack hundreds of targets in the depth of Lebanon, including Tyre, Sidon, Beirut, and Baalbek.

Overall, the Israel regime is preparing for military action against Hezbollah, and these threats are in line with its objective to conduct an aggression in Lebanon.

🔰 Israeli Aggression On Syria’s Homs, 9 Killed

▪️Early on February 7, the Israeli regime fighter jets attacked several areas in the city of Homs, which resulted in the martyrdom and wounding of several people.

According to a Syrian military source, “at around 00:30 (local time) on Wednesday, the Israeli regime targeted some locations in the city of Homs and its surroundings from the north of Tripoli. The Syrian air defense systems succeeded in destroying a number of Israeli missiles. This aggression led to the martyrdom and wounding of a number of Syrian civilians and financial damage to public and private property.”

▫️According to Homs health director, Dr. Muslim Al-Atassi, the final death toll of Israeli regime airstrikes on the city of Homs is 9 martyrs and 13 wounded.

▪️The Israeli airstrikes reportedly targeted a site in the north of the city, a building behind the municipal stadium and another place near the reconstruction department in the south of Homs city.

It is worth mentioning that on February 2, the Israeli regime’s military jets fired a number of missiles at targets in the southern districts of the capital city of Damascus, during which one of the IRGC military advisers was martyred.

▫️ Our dear [Yemeni] people, despite the ongoing siege and the aggression that lasted nine years and has not ended to this day, have taken a courageous stand.

▫️ For every [Israeli] settler, there are more than 150,000 Muslims, unable to do anything for Palestinians, watching as some of them are killed with extreme brutality.

▫️ The children of our people are not afraid of America and are not afraid of Israel.

▫️ The prevailing state in our country among men and women is high awareness and real involvement in events with all their emotions and feelings.

▫️ If the mercenaries were in control of Yemen, the Red Sea would never have witnessed our actions today. For the first time, the Red Sea and the Strait of Bab al-Mandab became an effective means of pressure on the enemies. The impact of our country's situation and the Jewish lobby's discomfort with this situation is what made the Americans and the British engage in war against our country.

▫️ Our Yemeni people are standing up to the trinity of evil: America, Israel and Britain, with all the courage, and resilience that comes from religious affiliation and Qur'anic culture.

▫️ A handful of Zionist Jews have occupied the land of Palestine and are tormenting the Palestinian people in front of more than 50 countries with enormous capabilities.

▫️ Bold attacks were made on American and British ships this morning.

▫️ The funny thing is that the United States is now resorting to camouflaging its commercial ships in the same way that Israel does, placing on them the flags of countries like the Marshall Islands.

▫️ I warn them and say that they must stop the aggression against Gaza and end the siege, otherwise we will seek further escalation.

🔰 Yemen’s Army Targets US And UK Ships In Red Sea

▪️On February 6, the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a missile operation against two US and UK-linked ships in the Read Sea. According to Brigadier General Saree, these attacks were precise and hit the targets.

▫️Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces, announced the details of the Yemeni navy’s missile attacks on two American and British ships. According to the statement, the Yemeni Navy attacked the ship ‘Star Nasia’ and ‘Morning Tide’ with several naval missiles in two separate operations in the Red Sea. According to Brigadier General Saree, these attacks were precise and hit the targets.

▪️The Yemeni Armed Forces emphasized that these attacks were carried out within the framework of Yemen’s legitimate right to respond to the aggression and defense of this country, and higher quality military operations will be carried out against all hostile American and British targets in the Red and Arabian seas. The Yemeni army also emphasized the continuation of operations against Israeli ships or ships heading towards occupied Palestinian ports until the blockade is lifted and aggression against the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is stopped.

The details of the ships that were attacked are as follows:
Star Nasia is a Marshall Islands-flagged bulk carrier that has been operating since 2006. This ship has been moving from Port Said in Egypt to Visakhapatnam port in India.
The Morning Tide ship is also a Barbados-flagged general cargo ship, which has been operating since 2006 and was sailing from the port of Port Said in Egypt to China.

👉 According to IWN’s assessment, the Star Nasia and Morning Tide ships are the 28th and 29th ships that have been attacked by missiles and drones by the Yemeni Armed Forces. The Yemenis have announced that this naval operation is aimed at supporting the Palestinian resistance and stopping the war in the Gaza Strip, and that it will only be carried out against American, British, and Israeli ships or their affiliated ships and not the international shipping.

🔰Latest Updates On The Gaza Strip; 122nd Day Of Fighting; Khan Yunis On The Verge Of Complete Collapse!

▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, during the last two weeks, the Israeli occupying forces slowly advanced in the western and northern areas of the city of Khan Yunis, and this city was completely surrounded. Currently, most of Khan Yunis city is under the control of Israeli forces, and only small parts of Al-Amal, Al-Nasr neighborhood and Khan Yunis camp are under the control of Palestinian forces.

▪️In the middle of the Gaza strip, there has been no special change during the last two weeks and the Israeli forces have practically stopped in their previous positions.

▪️In the north of the Gaza Strip, the situation has not changed. During the last few days, based on the field information, images and videos published from the north of Gaza, the Israeli forces have withdrawn from a number of other areas in the northwest of Gaza, from the al-Tawam area and its surroundings. Also, Israeli forces are still present in the southwestern areas of Gaza City along the coastline.

👉 Another important point that should not be neglected is the presence of Palestinian fighters in the north of the Gaza Strip. In videos that have been published of the recent advance of Israeli forces in the Rimal area, it shows that the Palestinian fighters are welcoming Israeli battle tanks with RPGs. This issue once again proves that the “Islamic World News” maps from the north of the Gaza Strip were correct and Palestinian fighters are still present in Gaza City. After the Israeli army withdrew from most of northern Gaza, many mistakenly believed that the northern Gaza Strip had been cleared of all Palestinian fighters and Israel has withdrawn from Gaza for this reason.

▫️In the political sphere, last Sunday, a meeting was held in Paris with representatives of the US, the Zionist regime, Egypt and Qatar, and the parties reached an agreement regarding the exchange of prisoners between the Hamas movement and the Israeli regime and the establishment of a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip. The contents of this proposal have been provided to the authorities of the Hamas movement, and Ismail Haniyeh is going to Cairo, the capital of Egypt, to review this agreement and proposals. Nevertheless, the Palestinian authorities are not optimistic about this issue and demand an end to the aggression of the Israeli regime and the complete withdrawal of the Zionist army forces from the Gaza Strip.

🔰 U.S. Military Conducts Third Large-Scale Airstrikes On Yemen (Video)

▫️Late on February 3, the US-British fighter jets carried out 48 airstrikes on Yemen, according to Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces.

The details of last night’s attacks are as follows:
▪️13 attacks in Sana’a province (Al-Nahdayn, Atan, Bani Hashish district, etc.)
▪️9 attacks in Hudaydah province. (Jabal al-Jada’ in the Al-Lahiya district, Al-Salif district and Aqban Island)
▪️11 attacks in Taiz province. (Al Barah and communication networks of Muqbanah and Haifan districts)
▪️7 attacks in Al-Baydha province. (Rada’ and Al-Sawadiya districts)
▪️7 attacks in Hajjah province. (Al-Jar area)
▪️1 attack in Saada province.

In his message, Brigadier General Saree emphasized that these attacks will not go unanswered, and Yemen will not give up on its moral, religious and humanitarian position of “supporting the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip”.

▪️The United States army’s terrorist headquarters in the region (CENTCOM) said in a statement that this operation is in line with the so-called international efforts to respond to increased Iranian-backed Houthi destabilizing and illegal activities in the region; And the strikes are intended to degrade Houthi capabilities used to continue their attacks on U.S. and U.K. ships as well as alleged international commercial shipping in the Red Sea, Bab Al-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden.

Of course, the term “international commercial shipping” by the United States means ships affiliated with Israel or destined for Israeli ports!

📊 According to this statement, the U.S. coalition operation was carried out with the participation of British fighter jets and with the support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands, and New Zealand at 23:30 (Sanaa time) against 36 Houthi targets in 13 locations in different areas of Yemen. These targets included multiple underground storage facilities, command and control, missile systems, UAV storage and operations sites, radars, and helicopters.

✍️ This operation is the third large-scale invasion of the American and UK armies in Yemen in support of Israel’s interests in the Red Sea. According to the published images and information, this operation was carried out by four Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets of the British Army and 24 U.S. F-18 fighter jets, as well as warships equipped with Tomahawk missiles.

Also, a few hours after this attack at 4 a.m. on February 4, the US military allegedly conducted a strike against an anti-ship cruise missile prepared to launch against ships in the Red Sea.

👉 According to Brigadier General Yahya Saree’s short message and the available evidence, the Yemeni Armed Forces will respond to this attack. The responses of the Yemeni army are currently limited to the level of missile and drone attacks on ships and naval fleets, and there is a possibility that it will become more widespread as tensions increase.

✍️ In a part of the statement of Sheikh Akram Al-Kaabi, Secretary General of the Islamic Resistance of Nujaba, it is stated:

▪️“We said and we repeat and emphasize that our decision is Iraqi and we will not stop until two things are achieved; Stopping Israel operations in Gaza and withdrawing the American occupation from Iraq. Regarding the temporary suspension of the activity of our comrades in Kataib Hezbollah, who are our brothers in blood, jihad, arms and path, I must say that after talking with the brother and commander of Mujahid Abu Hossein Al Hamidawi and clarifying the reasons for this decision, the truth and wisdom of it became clear to us. We respect this position and appreciate their sacrifice in this situation. In the future, it will be clear that he made this decision with courage and forgiveness.”

▫️After this statement, the positions of the American terrorists in Erbil and the Omar oil field were targeted by the resistance groups. It seems that the plan to stop attacks against American terrorists is not accepted by all resistance groups, and in the meantime, some groups insist on the continuation of actions against American soldiers until a clear result is achieved.

▪️According to what American officials and main stream media claim, the US airstrikes were aimed at disrupting the logistics and supply chain of the Iran’s IRGC and the Iran-backed resistance groups in Iraq and Syria.

👉 The so-called retaliatory airstrikes of the United States take place while even some prominent American experts and political figures acknowledge the futility and ineffectiveness of these attacks. Before these attacks, Biden and the US military officials have repeatedly announced that they do not intend to have a direct conflict with Iran and increase tension in the region.
These attacks and this type of reaction actually convey the US weakness. Basically, according to the capabilities and military equipment that United States has deployed in the West Asian region for years, there is no need to use long-range bombers and create so much noise!

▪️On the one hand, Biden and the US government are under severe pressure from American public opinion due to the death of three soldiers of this country in a recent attack and numerous missile, rocket and drone attacks on its bases in the last three months, and they are forced to react to get rid of this pressure. On the other hand, the United States knows very well that such airstrikes, which have been tried in Yemen before, will not affect the process of resistance attacks or stop them, but will certainly intensify the anti-US attacks. Although the attacks of the Iraqi resistance groups continued immediately after the US airstrikes on Iraq and Syria. 

👉 Therefore, resistance still defines the rules of the game and the US is forced to follow and act on what the resistance dictates. The US’s “show of power” in the latest attack will not change the main equation going on in West Asia.

▪️Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces, announced the missile attack of the Yemeni Navy on the American destroyer USS Gravely in the Red Sea.

▫️Brigadier General Saree declared all the American and British warships stationed in the Red and Arab seas that are participating in the aggression against Yemen as the “target bank” of the Yemeni Armed Forces and said: “Our forces emphasize that until the end of the aggression against Gaza and the lifting of its siege, they continue to block Israeli shipping and ships going to occupied Palestinian ports.”

▪️The US central command also announced early today that “at 23:30 on Tuesday, the USS Gravely destroyer succeeded in destroying an Ansar Allah anti-ship cruise missile in western Yemen.” According to the American claim, Ansar Allah’s attack was neutralized and there was no damage or casualties.

USS Gravely is a US Navy's Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer that was sent to the Mediterranean Sea and then the Red Sea after the start of the war in Palestine. This destroyer is equipped with advanced defense systems and missile weapons, including Tomahawk cruise missiles.

🔰 A Review Of Actions Made By Axis Of Resistance Against US, Israel In Region: US Bases Struck 200 Times!

▪️The missile and drone attacks by resistance groups against the positions of US terrorist forces in the West Asia region, which began after the Israeli regime’s military aggression against the Gaza Strip and aimed at putting pressure on the regime’s forces, continue and the scope of these attacks has also covered the positions of the Israeli regime in the occupied Palestinian territories.

▫️The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella group representing several Iraqi armed factions, immediately began attacks against the forces of the Israeli regime in the region a few days after the onset of the battle between the Israeli regime military forces and the Palestinian resistance fighters. With the intensity of the clashes and the reaction of the United States to the resistance actions, the quality and quantity of the attacks also increased. Over time, the scope of these attacks expanded and spread to the positions of the Israeli-occupied territories.

💥💥 Up to the time of writing this news story (23:00 Jan 30), resistance groups have carried out 200 missile, rocket, and drone operations against the illegal bases of the US terrorist army in the countries of Iraq and Syria as well as the occupied Palestinian territories.

✍️ These attacks by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq continued even after the recent agreement between the incumbent government in Baghdad and Washington’s Biden administration regarding the withdrawal of American military forces from the Arab country. It seems that, despite the announcements about the withdrawal of the United States from Iraq, as long as the departure of the occupiers is not visibly and realistically seen on the ground, the resistance group’s attacks will not cease. Iraqi resistance groups insist on the actual withdrawal of US forces from both Iraq and Syria.

✍️ However, it should be added that after the drone attacks on al-Tanf area and al-Rukban base on January 28, which resulted in the death of 3 American soldiers; Kataib Hezbollah of Iraq, one of the powerful subgroups of Islamic Resistance in Iraq, announced the temporary halt of attacks on American bases in Syria and Iraq. However, it seems that the attacks of other groups on American positions are continuing.

🔰 Kata’ib Hezbollah In Iraq Announces Suspension Of Anti-US Operations

▪️The Secretary-General of Kata’ib Hezbollah in Iraq announced the temporary suspension of operations against US terrorist forces in a statement.

▫️Abu Hussein al-Hamidawi, Secretary-General of Kata’ib Hezbollah that is the most powerful faction in the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, issued the statement on January 30, announcing the temporary suspension of attacks against US positions in Syria and Iraq.

✍️ Al-Hamidawi emphasized in the statement: Taking a step on the path of jihad is difficult and arduous, and the cost of it is heavy; so, those who take this step will find that the reward of martyrdom, no matter how great, is insignificant in comparison to almighty God’s satisfaction and support for the oppressed. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq’s Kata’ib Hezbollah faction, with its own will and without the interference of others, has decided to support the oppressed and steadfast people of Gaza. Our brothers on the resistance axis, especially in the Islamic Republic of Iran, are not exactly aware of our jihadi work, and they were very opposed to the pressure and tension against the US occupying forces in Iraq and Syria. We acted with wisdom and prudence in our adherence to our human and ideological duty, and in the most difficult and harshest conditions, we carefully observed the religious and moral standards.

✍️ In the final section of the statement, it is emphasized: In order to prevent the embarrassment of the Iraqi government, we declare the suspension of military and security operations against the occupying forces, and we will continue to defend our people in Gaza in other ways. We recommend the brave and free fighters of Kata’ib Hezbollah to temporarily act in a defensive manner in the event of any hostile US action against them.

▪️It seems that the cessation of attacks against the US positions is due to a request by the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani, especially after the recent Baghdad-Washington agreement for the withdrawal of US troops from Iraq; so far, no details have been released about the reason for this decision by the resistance group, and certainly in the coming days, more dimensions will be revealed in this regard.

▫️After the unveiling of the Almas missile and its similarity with the Israeli “Spike” missile, the attention of many military experts was drawn to this missile.

🔰 A Prominent ISIS Commander Killed In Daraa

▪️During the armed conflict between ISIS terrorists and Syrian security forces in the city of Nawa, the commander of the Hauran district of the ISIS terrorist group was killed.

▫️On January 28, the Syrian security forces started an operation with the aim of arresting ISIS elements in the city of Nawa, located in Daraa province. The armed battles lasted for several hours, and one of the ISIS terrorists, who was equipped with an explosive belt, blew himself up.

▫️As a result of this conflict, Osama Shehadah Al-Azizi, the commander of the Hauran region of the ISIS terrorist group, and five others were killed.

▪️It is worth mentioning that after the series of SAA operations against ISIS in Daraa province in 2018, it was believed that the hidden cells of this group were disintegrated in Daraa, but after about four years, the activities of ISIS resumed in this province. Since last year, this province has witnessed the activities of ISIS elements and their conflict with the Syrian military.

✍️ In recent months, the activity of ISIS cells and terrorist groups in different areas of Syria has increased sharply with the aim of putting pressure on the resistance axis and disrupting the focus of the Resistance from fighting Israel. Daraa province is not exempt from this issue. Considering the rising trend of ISIS attacks and movements in southern Syria, it seems that the employers of this terrorist group have special plans for Daraa and Quneitra and the borders of the occupied Golan.

🔰 Germany Opens Land Corridor To Dodge Bab Al-Mandab Strait Threat

▪️The German shipping company Hapag-Lloyd AG has issued a statement, announcing the creation of a land corridor from the ports of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Saudi Arabia in the Persian Gulf to the Saudi port of Jeddah in western Saudi Arabia.

According to the company’s official statement, this corridor is an appropriate emergency solution due to the turbulent conditions in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. In this land corridor, commercial ships unload their cargo at the port of Jebel Ali in the United Arab Emirates and the ports of Dammam and al-Jubail in Saudi Arabia, and Hapag-Lloyd’s trailers and trucks transport the cargo to the port of Jeddah in western Saudi Arabia, where the goods are handed over to other ships for further transit towards the Suez Canal.

It’s worth mentioning that due to the armed operations by Yemeni forces in the Red Sea, Hapag-Lloyd’s cooperation with Israeli companies was hindered, leading to the suspension of the passage of the German company’s ships through this route on January 15.

As a result of this plan by Hapag-Lloyd AG, which is the largest German shipping company, Israel’s comprehensive program to neutralize Yemeni military operations in the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea is expected to be implemented; so, they would be able to partly alleviate the need for Israeli ships as well as Israel-linked vessels to pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea.

The project of establishing a land corridor from the Persian Gulf to the Israeli-occupied ports and the Red Sea led by the Israeli company TRAKnet is currently underway with the cooperation of certain Arab countries, especially the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia. Potential reactions from resistance groups in the Arabian Peninsula and their possible drone and roadside bombing operations against logistics convoys in these corridors are among the threats to this project.

🔰 US Military Forces Killed, Wounded In Attack By Islamic Resistance In Iraq

▪️Following a drone attack by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq on an US army base in the Al-Tanf region located on the Syria-Jordan border, three American servicemen were killed and 25 others were injured.

Hours after the attack, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) issued a statement confirming the killing of three US soldiers and the injury of 25 others in the drone attack by Iraqi resistance fighters on the US military base in northeastern Jordan.

Reacting to this incident, US President Joe Biden confirmed the deaths of the country’s soldiers in Jordan and announced that three US soldiers were killed and several others were injured in a drone strike on their forces in northeastern Jordan near the Syrian border.

The US President claimed that the attack that led to the killing of three US soldiers was carried out by Iran-backed groups.

While Washington officials have spoken about the drone strike on the US military headquarters in northeastern Jordan, Jordanian officials, including the spokesperson for the government of the country, stated that the American base targeted by the drone attack is located outside the borders of Jordan and no incident occurred on Jordanian soil.

▪️In this regard, it should be noted that American occupying forces are present in three points in Al-Tanf region, Al-Tanf base, Al-Zaqaf military site and Al-Rukban military camp near Al-Rukban refugee camp. The US Al-Rukban military camp is located inside Jordan and about 600 meters from the Syrian border. Today's attack by the resistance forces, in addition to al-Tanf base, also targeted al-Rukban base, which resulted in the death of three Americans and wounding of 25 others.

This is the first time that the US has confirmed the killing of its soldiers as a result of attacks by Islamic resistance groups on US bases since the start of the war in the Gaza Strip. It is expected that the terrorist US army, in response to this incident, will carry out attacks against the positions of Islamic resistance groups in Iraq and eastern Syria.

🔰 Islamic Resistance In Iraq Vows to Continue Attacks on US Military Positions

▪️The Islamic Resistance in Iraq has issued a statement in response to the recent agreement between the Iraqi government and the United States regarding the status of American troops in the Arab country and related news.

The statement from the Islamic Resistance in Iraq states that the parliamentary resolution and popular support for the expulsion of foreign forces, in recent years, due to the United States’ deception, have not led anywhere. The US is seeking to implement its sinister plans in Iraq and the region. The reason Washington has agreed to the Iraqi government’s request to determine the tasks of its forces is due to the recent attacks carried out by the Islamic resistance fighters.

✍️ The Islamic Resistance in Iraq emphasized in this statement: We have seen nothing from the US enemy in years of struggle, except deception and coercion, and this country has always tried to buy time to carry out more of its devilish plans. The response of the Islamic resistance to the US is the continuation of jihad operations against foreign presence, and we warn against granting any kind of immunity to any foreign forces under any pretext.

▫️It is worth mentioning that the Iraqi Foreign Ministry announced a few days ago, before the agreement with the US regarding the formation of a joint military committee to assess the danger of the ISIS terrorist group and the end of the US-led coalition mission in Iraq.

▪️The exit of US forces from Iraq and the agreement between the government in Baghdad and the administration in Washington is not a new issue. In the tenure of former Prime Minister Mustafa Al-Kadhimi and in the last round of strategic talks between Baghdad and Washington, it was agreed that the presence of American military forces in Iraq would end by the end of 2021, but the American administration easily violated the agreement!

👉 The Iraqi resistance, due to being completely familiar with the bad faith of the US side and its history of acting contrary to its commitments, has decided to continue its military operations, unless real and positive measures are taken regarding the withdrawal of American forces from Iraq.

▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, during the last week, Israeli forces slowly expanded the zone of control in Khan Yunis city. Israeli forces are slowly advancing west of Khan Yunis. In the south of the city, the zone of control has been extended to the vicinity of Absan al-Kabirah.

▪️In the center of the Gaza Strip, clashes continue in al-Bureij and al-Maghazi and in the east of Nusirat. During the last week, Israeli forces advanced in the southern areas of al-Maghazi. Also, partial advances have been made in the east of Nusirat.

🔰Rocket, Missile Attack On US Positions At Ain Al Asad Air Base

▪️The United States occupying forces’ positions at the Ain al-Asad base, located in Iraq’s Al Anbar governorate, were targeted in a rocket and missile attack by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq on the January 20.

▫️In the early hours when the incident occurred, some media outlets, citing US sources, reported that the resistance forces used short-range ballistic missiles to target the Ain al-Asad base, and there were reports of injuries and casualties among US forces.

▪️Several hours after this attack, the US Central Command (CENTCOM) also confirmed reports of a missile attack on Ain al-Asad airbase by issuing a statement. The statement said that around 18:30 (local time), several ballistic missiles and rockets were fired by Iran-backed militia groups towards Ain al-Asad airbase. Most of the missiles were intercepted by the base’s air defense systems, but some of them hit the military base. According to initial assessment, some US personnel suffered traumatic brain injuries and at least one Iraqi soldier was injured.

Therefore, given the confirmation of the missile attack, it can be speculated that the resistance forces used short-range ballistic missiles, including Al-Aqsa 1 and Sarem, which have recently been unveiled by the Iraqi resistance.

✍️ This attack was carried out in a hybrid tactic by using rockets and ballistic missiles to yield better result. In this way, by firing a large number of rockets towards Ain al-Asad airbase, the base’s defense systems faced a large number of rockets, increasing the chances of short-range ballistic missiles hitting targets inside the base.

👉 Based on available information, this attack is considered the second major strike on Ain Al Asad airbase in terms of volume and power of the fired projectiles after Iran’s missile attack on the base. Undoubtedly, these types of attacks are several stages higher and more powerful than routine daily attacks on US positions in the region and will greatly increase the casualties and damages.

Iran still emphasizes brotherliness and friendship with the Pakistani people and the preservation of the territorial integrity of this country, but it will not hesitate in facing terrorists and protecting Iranians’ lives. If the security shortcomings of the friendly and brotherly Pakistani government do not turn into active and effective cooperation, Iran will not hesitate to carry out such preemptive operations again in the future.

On Friday, Iran FM Hossein Amirabdollahian also emphasized the serious pursuit of security and military cooperation between the two countries in a phone conversation with Jalil Abbas Jilani. For his part, Jilani emphasized the common approach of the two nations in combating terrorism and stressed the necessity of maintaining constructive and fraternal relations with Tehran, inviting Amirabdollahian to visit Islamabad.

👉 Therefore, it is now possible to hope for a joint security plan between the two countries in border areas of Pakistan and Iran, and perhaps now is the time for Pakistan to seriously consider its fight against terrorist groups in the west of the neighboring country.

🔰 The Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC) released images of monitoring and attacking the headquarters of the Jaish al-Adl terrorists in the border areas of Pakistan.

▪️This video was broadcast as a TV report by the official media of Iran and made available to the public.

📌 In this report, the IRGC drone is shown monitoring the headquarters of Jaish ul-Adl terrorists in the mountainous region near the Iran-Pakistan border. The base is one of the main headquarters of the Jaish ul-Adl terrorist group in Pakistani territory. As it is clear in the images, they show different parts of the base, observation hills, armed individuals stationed there, and a training ground for terrorist training and shooting exercise. The terrorist base is located deep in the mountains and valleys of the Kouh-Sabz (Green Mountain), making ground access difficult.

📃 According to IRGC data, terrorists have been using this headquarters for training and planning terrorist operations inside Iranian territory for two decades. Recently, about 50 terrorists entered this headquarters for planning, coordination, and preparation for a large terrorist operation inside Iran. Three days ago (on January 16), they were targeted by Iranian drone and missile attacks, thwarting their evil intentions and resulting in the killing and injury of some terrorists.
Monitoring of Jaish-ul-Adl terrorist headquarters in Pakistan’s Sabz Mountain

▪️The release of this video once again proves the accuracy of Iran’s claim regarding the existence of Jaish ul-Adl terrorist bases in border areas in western Pakistan. Iran had repeatedly informed the friendly and brotherly country, Pakistan, about these bases and had urged them to take action against these terrorist bases by providing information about them to the Pakistani government and army. Unfortunately, due to various reasons, the Pakistani government and army refrained from destroying these bases or taking effective action against Jaish ul-Adl terrorists. Therefore, to prevent new terrorist disasters in Iranian territory, Iran was forced to intensify its targeting of the terrorists’ base in the Kouh-Sabz, which was not welcomed by the Pakistani government.

▪️On the other hand, however, the Pakistani government, in order to escape intense public pressure and scorn by its Indian rivals, was forced to carry out a retaliatory operation; but against whom? Against some Pakistani migrants who had turned into a tragic disaster, resulting in the loss of lives of women and children.
👉 However, Pakistan claimed that it has targeted the headquarters and hideouts of the Balochistan Liberation Army-Balochistan Liberation Front (BLA – BLF) in Iranian territory. Some Pakistani media outlets have gone so far as to make a strange claim that Iran is harboring terrorists from BLA-BLF! This claim is being made while the government and army of Pakistan can never find a terrorist base in Iran like the one in the Kouh-Sabz of Pakistan and publish its videos, or release images to prove their claim!

✍️ Once again, we refer you to the statements of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs regarding the recent events of the past few days, as well as Friday’s phone conversation between the Iranian foreign minister and his Pakistani counterpart. Iran, before and after the attack, even after Pakistan’s attack on Iranian soil, addressed Pakistan in a friendly and brotherly tone, but strongly reminded them of their previous security commitments and urged them to act in line with them.

2024-01-19T00:25:00+00:00,-1001458314607,"🔰 Some facts about the recent tensions between #Pakistan and #Iran:

▪️The eastern neighboring country of Iran has been plagued by political and economic instability, as well as extremist ideologies, during its 77 years since its formation in 1947. 

▫️Despite having a well-equipped military and intelligence agency, the internal turmoil has led to the nurturing of terrorists and the exploitation of various ethnic groups such as Pashtuns and Balochs by intelligence agencies from the UK, U.S. and more importantly the Israeli Mossad. 

▪️The consequences of these issues have affected all neighboring  countries, from Afghanistan to Iran and somehow on India. Therefore, the solution to this problem lies in the actions and reforms of the Pakistani government to rectify the internal structure of the country.

▫️Iran’s preventive strike on Jaish ul-Adl terrorists in Pakistan border may have been a wake-up call for the Pakistani government to find a swift solution to this matter. The reminder of this message in the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Iran is quite clear. 

▪️Before and after the strike and even after Pakistan attack on Iranian soil, Iran addressed Pakistan with a firm, friendly and brotherly tone and asked it to fulfill its previous security obligations. This fraternal tone of Iran should not be interpreted by Pakistanis as a message of weakness.

▫️The power of terrorist groups like Taliban, BLA, Lashkar-e-Taiba, etc., has increased due to the negligence of the Pakistani government military or the conflicting policies of security systems, and this insecurity is now manifesting itself in border conflicts with neighbors .

▪️A friendly and brotherly advice to Pakistan is: deal with terrorist groups in the north and west of the country, before it is too late. The enemies of the people of Pakistan and Iran are clearly seeking to exploit this ominous opportunity!

▪️It should be noted that Jaish-ul-Adl is behind many terrorist attacks in the southeast of Iran and Iran has always warned Pakistan about the terrorist activities of this group. Recently, 11 Iranian police officers were killed by this terrorist group in the Rask police station in the southeast of Iran. Therefore, Iran's attacks were predictable. 

🇮🇷🇵🇰 Although the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan condemned this attack by publishing a statement, nevertheless, the recent attack on Jaish-ul-Adl was probably carried out in coordination with Pakistan. It seems that if Pakistan does not have the ability to contain this terrorist group, in the future, Iran will carry out more attacks in coordination with the Pakistani army and government to clean up and destroy this terrorist group from the border areas.

🔰 The Armed Forces of Yemen took responsibility for the missile attack on the US ship GIBRALTAR EAGLE in the Gulf of Aden by publishing a statement.

▪️The statement is as follows:
“The naval forces of the Yemeni Armed Forces carried out a military operation targeting an American ship (GIBRALTAR EAGLE) in the Gulf of Aden, with a number of appropriate naval missiles, and the hit was accurate and direct. All American and British ships and warships involved in the aggression against our country are considered hostile targets by the Yemeni armed forces.
The Yemeni Armed Forces confirm that a retaliation to the American and British attacks is unavoidable, and that no future attack will go unpunished.
The Yemeni armed forces continue to carry out their military operations and implement the decision to block Israeli navigation in the Arab and Red Seas until the aggression stops and the siege on the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip is lifted.
The Yemeni Armed Forces confirm the continuation of trade movement in the Arab and Red Seas to all destinations except for the ports of occupied Palestine and that they continue to take all defensive and offensive measures within the right to defend and confront the American-British aggression”

The missile operation of the Yemeni armed forces was carried out today against the American bulk carrier “Gibraltar Eagle” 95 miles southeast of Aden. Previously, Ansar Allah carried out most of its attacks in the Red Sea, and this caused the naval fleets of the American coalition to be deployed in the Red Sea to repel and neutralize these attacks. The addition of the Gulf of Aden to the scope of the Yemeni army’s targets will have heavy costs for the US military and may even force the US coalition to send more warships to Yemeni waters.

According to reports, this will be the largest deployment of soldiers of the Army National Guard of the United States from New Jersey to the West Asia region since 2008. These military forces will be stationed in Iraq and Syria for approximately 10 months.

It is worth mentioning that approximately 2,500 US soldiers are present in various regions of Iraq, and around 900 soldiers are stationed in eastern Syria as well.

The decision to deploy military forces to Iraq and Syria under the framework of the coalition against the ISIS terrorist group has been made at a time when the Iraqi authorities and Islamic resistance groups are more than ever pursuing the plan to expel US soldiers from Iraq. The increased US activities and the deployment of more military forces to Syria and Iraq could escalate tensions in the West Asia region.

🔰 Why The Israeli Regime Withdrew From The Areas in Gaza City?

In recent days, conflicting maps have been published regarding the situation on the ground in the northern Gaza Strip.

Some believe that the Israeli regime’s forces have completely withdrawn, while others do not accept the Israeli army’s withdrawal and they highlight Israel’s presence in the Gaza city based on the United States think tanks’ maps or pro-Israeli viewpoints. Some consider the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas to be completely victorious, while others consider the Israeli regime to be triumphant.

However, all these differences of opinion, preferences, oppositions, and biased gestures have no effect on the reality of what is actually happening in the northern Gaza Strip.

For instance, when there are dozens of videos and reports confirming that Israeli forces have left Beit Hanoun city and taken positions on the outskirts of the city, what difference does it make if some pro-Israeli cartographers or the US think tank show Beit Hanoun as completely under Israeli control? Well, they can do that, but the reality does not change; time will show everything…

▪️Some question why the Israeli regime withdrew from the occupied areas in Gaza City?
The answer to this question is that although the Israeli regime has withdrawn from many areas in northern Gaza, it has not withdrawn from northern Gaza and has even achieved some of its objectives. The main goal of Israel’s attack on Gaza was to destroy the Palestinian resistance Hamas. However, the destruction and elimination of Gaza and its infrastructure is another ambition of the regime, or according to some experts, the main goal of the regime’s attack on Gaza, because they themselves know well that Hamas and the Palestinian resistance, which is actually a fundamental ideology, will not be eliminated by military operations in this way.

Therefore,
▫️Firstly, due to the very dense urban population and the presence of a vast network of undiscovered tunnels, establishing stable control over the city or, in other words, gaining complete military control over northern Gaza is not possible, and Israeli forces will be trapped in daily skirmishes with Palestinian fighters; so, they will suffer casualties.
▫️Secondly, the cost of war in Gaza is staggering, and Israelis prefer to avoid war costs as much as possible in their current economic situation.
▫️Thirdly, the Israeli regime’s army prefers to withdraw from this area, recover, and send forces to other active fronts in the middle and south of the Gaza Strip, rather than engaging in endless urban warfare in Gaza City and the northern Gaza Strip.

Therefore, considering all the above issue, the Israeli regime has concluded that the best course of action is to withdraw from the urban areas of northern Gaza. This also applies to the middle and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, and the Israelis will eventually withdraw after the destruction and massacre.

▪️Now the question is that, has the Israeli regime destroyed the Palestinian resistance groups in Gaza City, or will it destroy them throughout the Gaza Strip? No, it cannot. But it has succeeded in maximum destruction of infrastructure and complete devastation of the Gaza Strip. Whether you perceive this reality as a victory or a defeat depends on your perspective and way of thinking!

🔰Latest Updates On The Gaza Strip; 97th Day Of Fighting

▫️Review of the latest military situation in the Gaza Strip after 97 days of fighting.

▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, during the last four days, Israeli forces increased the extent of their advances in the south and southwest of the city of Khan Yunis. In this axis, Israeli forces have reached Ghazan al-Najjar and clashes continue around this village. By advancing on this axis, the Israeli army plans to encircle the city of Khan Yunis from the south and cut off the roads leading to Rafah.
Clashes continue in the north of Khan Yunis. The Israeli forces have made advances in this direction in the last few days, but due to the urban context and the fierce resistance by the Palestinian fighters, the amount of advances is limited.

▪️In the middle of the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces are advancing slowly but steadily. On the Nuseirat front, Israeli forces slightly advanced in west of al-Maghraqa. On the al-Bureij front, Israeli forces have almost surrounded the al-Bureij camp and the fall of al-Bureij seems certain. On the al-Maghazi front, Israeli forces have advanced in the north and south of al-Maghazi and have bypassed this camp and are advancing on Salah al-Din road and its surrounding areas. The Juhr al-Dik front has obviously come under the control of the Israeli army after the recent advances of the Israeli army around al-Bureij and Nuseirat.

▪️In the north of the Gaza Strip, after the withdrawal of Israeli forces from inside the Gaza City to the outskirts of the city, there is no specific clashes in the north of the Gaza Strip. Only some sporadic clashes were reported in the outskirts of the city.

🔰 Riyadh To Normalize Ties With Israel After Gaza War: Saudi Envoy

Khalid bin Bandar Al Saud, Saudi Arabia’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, has emphasized that after the end of the war on the Gaza Strip, Saudi Arabia’s relations with the Israeli regime will be normalized and this agreement should lead to the formation of a Palestinian state.

Saudi officials have previously stated that they are seeking peace and the formation of a country for the Palestinians in these negotiations. They initially said that normalizing relations with the Israeli regime was impossible without the formation of a Palestinian state, but Khalid bin Bandar speaks of reducing this condition to determining a roadmap and practical strategy for its formation and solving Hamas in Palestine or in other words, removing Hamas. Overall, the Saudis are trying to squeeze concession from the Israeli reimage by using the Palestinian card, and it remains to be seen how far their pressure against the United States and the regime will continue and what the Saudis will trade for the Palestinian cause!

🔰 Iranian Navy: The Offending US Oil Tanker Was Seized

▪️On January 11, the Public Relations Department of the Navy for the Islamic Republic of Iran’s Army has officially declared the seizure of an American oil tanker in the waters off the Sea of Oman, citing a court order as the basis for the action.

▫️ Public Relations of the Islamic Republic of Iran Navy wrote in this statement: “Following the violation of the “Suez Rajan” ship last year and the theft of Iranian oil by the United States, the aforementioned oil tanker with the new name ST NIKOLAS was seized this morning. Last year, this oil tanker had stolen the cargo of oil belonging to the Islamic Republic of Iran under the guidance of the United States and transferred it to the ports of that country and provided it to the United States.
    This oil tanker that renamed to ST NIKOLAS, was carrying oil in the Oman Sea, which was seized this morning by a court order by the Navy of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in retaliation for oil theft by the American regime, and is being transferred to the ports of the Islamic Republic to be handed over to the authorities.”

It should be noted that the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported the seizure of a ship off the eastern coast of Oman by six unknown persons this morning.

As mentioned in the army’s statement, this ship is called ST NIKOLAS or formerly Suez Rajan, and was moving from the Iraqi port of Basra to Aliaga port on the western coast of Turkey. This tanker was seized by the United States on the coast of Singapore in an unknown date after February 2022 and its one million barrels of crude oil were sold; so, it was confiscated by the United States. Now, after a few months, the Iranian army trapped the same oil tanker and responded to the American organized piracy with a naval operation and returned the property of the Iranian nation.

🔰 Iran Seizes Oil Tanker; US-Stolen Crude Oil To Be Win Back!

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) reported that a security incident happened in the eastern Oman Sea, 50 miles east of Oman, on Thursday morning, and announced that unidentified individuals boarded a tanker and seized the vessel, and that this center cannot contact the crew of the ship.

 ▪️The most recent information shows that the name of the seized ship in the Oman Sea is ST NIKOLAS.

According to the studies of the IWN, this oil tanker was moving from the Iraqi port of Basra to Aliaga port on the western coast of Turkey. This tanker was previously operating under the name of SUEZ RAJAN affiliated to the Marshall Islands flag and belonged to the Greek company Empire Navigation. This tanker was seized by the United States on the coast of Singapore in an unknown date after February 2022 and its one million barrels of crude oil were sold; so, it was confiscated by the United States. The US fined the Greek company $2.4 million for smuggling oil to Iran and put the tanker back into operation under the new name St Nikolas.

▫️It should be noted that after this incident, Iran had previously seized two oil tankers, Niovi and Advantage Sweet, in the Oman Sea. The seizure of the St Nicholas tanker, or Suez Rajan (if the news story is correct), can be interpreted as an operation to recover Iran’s property from the United States. Iran has recuperated its oil again!

🔰 US Military Claims Combat Against Ansar Allah’s Complex Attack In Red Sea

▪️The US CENTCOM has claimed that they repelled Yemeni Ansar Allah movement’s drone and missile attacks in the Red Sea.

According to the CENTCOM, the Ansar Allah movement attacked heavily and intricately with the use of several suicide drones and 18 cruise and anti-ship missiles on US and British ships in the southern Red Sea on Tuesday night, January 9.

Based on statistics announced by the US Army, this is the 26th attack of its kind by Yemeni armed forces on shipping lines in the Red Sea.

Yemeni officials had previously announced that the naval operations of the Yemeni armed forces in the Arabian Sea and the Red Sea are to support the people and resistance groups of Palestine, and as long as the war against the Israeli regime continues, they will attack the interests of the Israeli regime and the Israel-bound vessels.

The escalation of tensions between the Yemeni armed forces and the US-led coalition (Operation Prosperity Guardian) occurred after US helicopters attacked Yemeni navy boats in an operation to prevent the movement of the Maersk Hangzhou ship, killing 10 Yemeni soldiers. Yemeni government officials and the Ansar Allah movement have emphasized responding to this criminal attack.

An hour ago, the Yemeni Armed Forces issued a statement and took responsibility for the attacks. In the statement of Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman of the Yemeni armed forces, it is stated:
“The naval, missile and drone forces of the Yemeni armed forces conducted a joint military operation with a large number of ballistic missiles, naval missiles and suicide drones against an American ship that supported the interests of the Zionist regime. This operation was carried out in response to the attack of American enemy forces on our navy. The Yemeni armed forces emphasize that they will not hesitate to properly deal with all hostile threats within the framework of the legitimate defense of the country and the people of Yemen. The Yemeni armed forces will continue to prevent the passage of Israeli ships and ships bound for occupied Palestinian ports in the Arab and Red Sea until the end of the aggression and the lifting of the blockade of our brothers in the Gaza Strip. The Yemeni Armed Forces declares its full protection of the continued traffic of foreign ships in the Red and Arabian seas to all destinations, except the occupied Palestinian ports.”

🔰 Latest Updates On The Gaza Strip; 94th Day Of Fighting

Currently, the central and southern areas of the Gaza Strip are the most active fronts in the Gaza Strip.

▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, clashes continued in the center and south of the city of Khan Yunis. According to field information, the Zionist occupying forces have destroyed the agricultural lands and the houses of the citizens in front of the Khan Younis Faculty of Science and Technology. This shows that the Israeli forces are advancing in the southwest of Khan Yunis city.

▪️In the middle of the Gaza Strip, clashes continued in Al-Bureij and Al-Maghazi and around Nuseirat as well as at the entrance of Al-Zawayda. Israeli artillery and fighter jets are severely targeting Al-Zawayda area. By putting pressure on Al-Zawayda and advancing on this axis, the Israeli regime plans to surround Nuseirat and approach Deir al-Balah.

▪️In the north of the Gaza Strip, after the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the inner areas of the city, there is no specific ground conflict in Gaza City and the Israeli regime has turned to airstrikes again. However, today clashes were reported near Kuwait junction in the southern suburbs of Al-Zaytoun neighborhood. Kuwait junction is located on the 10th street in the contact line between the Israeli and Palestinian forces. Earlier we announced that the Israeli forces have retreated to behind the 10th street in south of Gaza City. In fact, clashes around Kuwait junction once again confirms the correctness of the IWN map regarding the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the north of the Gaza Strip.

👉 It is also said that the Israeli regime has completed its withdrawal from the northern areas of the Gaza Strip. If this claim is true, the few remaining areas in the north of Gaza should also be cleared of the Zionists.

▪️Jordanian army’s fighter jets targeted positions in the Al-Shaab, Arman, and Melh areas located in the as-Suwayda Governorate in southern Syria.

▪️It is reported that as a result of this attack, three individuals, including a drug smuggler, were killed. Further details have not been disclosed regarding this matter.

▪️Prior to this attack, a military source in the Central Command of the Jordanian Armed Forces (JAF) had announced that the army of this Arab country has been engaged in armed clashes with large groups of smugglers on the northern borders since early Saturday morning.

▪️Under the pretext of fighting drug smugglers, the Jordanian army carried out attacks on positions in southern Syria over the course of recent months, resulting in the loss of several civilians and injuries to dozens of others.

🔰 ISIS Attack On Syrian Military Bus Leaves 23 Martyrs Or Wounded In Homs Desert

▪️A bus carrying Syrian soldiers in the desert eastern Homs Governorate was targeted by a roadside bomb planted by the ISIS terrorist group. As a result of this incident, at least 9 Syrian soldiers were martyred and 14 others were injured.

This attack took place three days after the Syrian army’s operation against ISIS hideouts in the Syrian desert. This is the second attack by ISIS terrorists on the Syrian army in the past 10 days.

On January 1, attacks against Syrian troops by ISIS terrorists resulted in the martyrdom of 9 soldiers of the Syrian army and its allied forces.

▫️Following the failure of the US regime’s airstrikes against the Resistance to stop missile and rocket attacks on its bases, the activities of ISIS terrorist groups in the region have recently intensified. The study of the trend of ISIS attacks and movements indicates that the terrorist group’s assassination machine may have been activated at the request of its employers, namely the US and Israeli intelligence services. The main objective of these attacks is to distract the Resistance and undermine its focus on the battle against the Israeli regime.

▪️Elements of the ISIS terrorist group launched an assault on Syrian army positions in the Al-Sukhnah area, located in eastern Syria’s Homs Governorate, from three axes, resulting in the martyrdom and injury of several Syrian soldiers.

On January 7, ISIS terrorists launched their attack on Al-Sukhnah, located in the Homs Governorate, from the Al-Taybah and Al-Kum axes (in north), Al-Zabiat axis (in south), and the Arak axis (in west). This led to intense clashes between the terrorists and the Syrian armed forces.

As a result of this confrontation, three Syrian soldiers were martyred, and several others were injured. Additionally, several ISIS terrorists were also killed.

It is worth mentioning that the geographic location of Al-Sukhnah, close to areas under ISIS infiltration, which are also their hideouts (southwest of Deir ez-Zor desert and east of Palmyra ancient city), has made it a frequent target of attacks by ISIS terrorists.

▫️The analysis of raids and movements made by the ISIS group indicates an increase in their activities through the support and requests of the United States. The major aim of these ISIS attacks in the Syrian governorates such as Deir ez-Zor, Homs, etc., is to disrupt and weaken the resistance axis.

🔰Hezbollah Field Commander Assassinated In Israeli Drone Attack On Kherbet Selem

▫️As a result of the Israeli army’s combat drone attack on a vehicle in the town of Kherbet Selem, one of the senior field commanders of the resistance movement Hezbollah in Lebanon, known as Hajj Jawad Taweel, also known as Wissam Hassan, was martyred.

Local media earlier reported the injury of two individuals in this attack prior to announcing the martyrdom of this Lebanese commander. These sources also referred to Hajj Jawad as one of the commanders of Al-Ridwan Brigade, also known as Al-Ridwan Special Forces (Hezbollah’s special forces).

The assassination of field commanders and key figures of resistance groups in Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and Palestine remains at the forefront of the joint plans of the United States and the Israeli regime.

It should be noted that the skies of Arab countries and the Mediterranean Sea are filled day and night with the US, Israeli, and British spy planes and drones, and all the movements of resistance forces on the ground are under the surveillance of the United States and the Tel Aviv regime.

The execution of these assassinations is a top priority in the third stage of the Israeli army’s operations, and its implementation is pursued under the supervision of American and European military advisors.

According to the latest field information, the Israeli regime’s armed forces have advanced several blocks along Jamal Abdul Naser Street and Osama Al-Najjar Street.

Khan Yunis, like other areas, has witnessed a lot of destruction. After advancing in each area, the Israeli regime’s occupying forces explode and destroy buildings and homes as much as possible. Large parts of eastern Khan Yunis have been completely destroyed so far.

🔰 Latest Military Situation In Gaza Strip; 93rd Day Of Fighting – Israeli Forces Retreats From Northern Gaza

As we reported yesterday that the Israeli regime has been retreating from more areas in the northern Gaza Strip; this issue has been confirmed today following the publication of videos and images of battlefields from northern Gaza. Also, senior member of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas Osama Hamdan emphasized this afternoon (Jan 7) that the Israeli regime has retreated from the northern Gaza Strip.

However, it is necessary to mention that Israeli army forces are present in small parts of western areas of Beit Lahia city and western Al-Tawam Street, but they will probably also retreat soon. Israeli forces entered the northern Gaza Strip during the first days of the war and will now leave those areas in the final stage of their retreat.

In the south of Gaza City, according to available information, the tenth street has been determined as the last line of retreat for the Israeli regime’s army forces. In other words, the Israeli regime’s military forces have retreated from neighborhoods such as Al-Zeitoun, Tel Al-Hawa, Al-Sheikh Ijlin, and so on, to behind the tenth street. It seems that these areas will remain under Israeli occupation until the end of the Israeli regime’s operation in the center of the Gaza Strip.

▫️So, what did the Israeli regime achieve in the northern Gaza Strip?

Yesterday (Jan 6), the spokesperson for the Israeli regime’s army claimed that Israeli armed forces have completed dismantling Hamas’s military structure in the northern Gaza Strip! And that the Israeli regime’s military forces have done so many efforts and that how many commanders and fighters they have killed and how many tunnel networks we have destroyed, etc., and now the focus of the Israeli regime’s army is on operations in the center and south of the Gaza Strip.

However, contrary to the Israeli regime’s claim, the fact is that the Israeli regime did not even come close to achieve its main goal of destroying the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas even for a moment during the Gaza war and its only achievement in the northern Gaza Strip was destruction of buildings and mass murder. It is certain that the Israeli regime will not succeed in achieving its goal in the center and south of the Gaza Strip either.

On the other hand, it is true that so far, international observers have witnessed unprecedented destruction in northern Gaza and some Palestinian resistance commanders and fighters have been martyred, and a network of tunnels has been destroyed, but all of these can be replaced and repaired. Tunnels and buildings will be rebuilt, and forces will be replaced. The very important point is that during these three months, the Israeli regime never managed to take full control of the northern Gaza Strip, and now after the withdrawal of occupying forces from this region, Palestinian fighters are still present in Gaza and have control over the areas.

▪️In the center of the Gaza Strip, clashes continue in Al-Bureij and Al-Mughazi refugee camps as well as around Al-Nuseirat refugee camp. The Israeli regime’s armed forces have made partial advances in the Juhr al-Dik area. Also, the Israeli regime’s military forces have advanced between Al-Bureij and Al-Mughazi refugee camps and have reached Salah al-Din Road, the main highway that runs through the strip from north to south and connects all of its towns. Given that the Israeli regime’s forces have been dispatched from the northern Gaza Strip to the central and southern axes of the Gaza Strip, ground battles in this axis are truly unequal, and Palestinian resistance fighters face a difficult task of preserving these areas.

Dehlavieh 3 anti-tank guided missile, the longest-range Iranian anti-tank missile

During the unveiling ceremony of 10 new defense systems of Iran Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) on February 13th, the Dehlavieh-3 anti-tank guided missile was unveiled.

Examining the appearance of the Dehlavieh-3 ATGM and comparing it with the 9m133M-2 Kornet-EM missile, it can be seen that the Dehlavieh-3 is almost completely similar to the Russian model.

The 9m133M-2 missile with a maximum range of 8,000 meters is the longest-range man-portable anti-tank missile in the world, and now Iran’s MODAFL has introduced the Iranian version of this missile into mass production. Earlier, the missile was seen for the first time in 2021 during the visit of the Chief of Staff for the Armed Forces of Iran, Major General Sardar Bagheri to the Exhibition of achievements of the Iranian Ministry of Defense in Tehran.

The 9m133M-2 missile has the strongest warhead of anti-tank missiles in the world in terms of penetration, and its warhead is equivalent to 10 kg of TNT, and its warhead can penetrate up to 1300 mm in rolled steel.

In this unveiling, a version of Dehlavieh 3 anti-armor missile, which is similar to the 9m133FM-2 model, was also unveiled with a red body. This version of the missile intended for use against light armored vehicles, personnel, field fortifications and buildings with thermobaric warhead.

Dehlavieh 3 missile (9m133m-2 Kornet EM) specifications:
Range: 8000-150 meters
Armor penetration: 1300-1100 mm
Maximum speed: 300 meters per second
Missile weight (including container): 31 kg
Missile tube length: 1210 mm

🔰 Hezbollah ATGM Missiles Accurately Hit Meron Base At A Distance Of 8 Kilometers! (Video)

▪️Hezbollah published the moment when rockets and ATGM missiles hit the Meron Air Surveillance Base on the summit of Mount Carmel in northern occupied Palestine.

According to the published video, Hezbollah probably used Iranian Fajr-1 rockets and Dehlavieh-3 anti-armor guided missiles (Iranian version of the Russian 9m133M-2 missile) in this attack, which is considered the longest-range ground-based anti-armor missile in the world.

▫️Meron Air Surveillance Base is located approximately 7 to 8 kilometers from the Lebanese border, and accurate hitting with Dehlavieh3 ATGM missiles at a distance of 8,000 meters is a very important issue!

▪️All in all, Hezbollah’s attack on Meron was carried out with enough amount of munitions and high accuracy, and the Israeli defense systems were unable to counter it. In this distance, the use of Mersad suicide drones (Ababil 2) can also be effective, but Hezbollah currently prefers to carry out its attacks with short-range rockets and anti-armor missiles and strike at a shallower depth.

▫️Disabling the Meron base through repeated attacks will multiply the costs and problems of the Israeli regime in the northern regions.

▫️The distance between Hezbollah positions in southern Lebanon and this base is about 10 kilometers. Therefore, Hezbollah can also use Mersad suicide drones (Ababil 2) to carry out attacks with more precision.

🔰 Latest Military Situation In The Gaza Strip; 90th Day Of Battles (Map)

▪️Three months have passed since the beginning of the war and during this time we have witnessed many events and many ups and downs. In these 90 days, the criminal regime of Israel has martyred 22,438 Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip and has set a new record of brutality in the history of mankind. The depth of this tragedy becomes more clear when we know that about 70% of the martyrs are children and women!

▪️On the other side, according to the Israeli regime, about 500 Israeli servicemen were killed in the first days of the war and after the ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. But unofficial statistics claim that the casualties of the Israeli army are more than 3,500.

▪️In the field and after the ground entry of the Israeli army into the Gaza Strip, so far something like 50% of the Gaza Strip has been occupied by Israeli forces. The Israelis are using the scorched earth policy to advance in different areas of the Gaza Strip, and after occupying new areas with the aim of destroying life in Gaza, they are again destroying the infrastructure as much as possible. Therefore, we see a lot of destruction. The extent of these destructions can be clearly seen in satellite images.

▫️The latest military situation in the Gaza Strip is as follows: In general, the military situation in different areas of the Gaza Strip has not changed significantly compared to the last four days, and the conflicts continue sporadically in all axes.
In the north of the Gaza Strip, clashes continue around the Jabalia camp and parts of Sheikh Radwan, Al-Tuffah and Al-Daraj neighborhoods.
In the middle of the Gaza Strip, the conflicts in the south and east of al-Maghazi continue fiercely. In Al-Bureij, Israeli forces are still present in the southern parts of this town and the clashes continue inside Al-Bureij. In Nuseirat, clashes continue in the east and north of this camp. Based on field information, it seems that the Israeli army has succeeded in making limited advances in north of Nuseirat.
In the south of the Gaza Strip, clashes continue in the central areas of the city of Khan Yunis. During the last four days, no progress has been reported, however, the only change is related to the Khan Yunis Municipality building. Israeli forces have occupied the Khan Yunis Municipality building near Abu Hamid square in the center of the city.

🔰 ISIS Claims Responsibility For Kerman Terrorist Attack

▪️The ISIS terrorist group has claimed responsibility for the terrorist attack in the Iranian city of Kerman by publishing a statement.

According to the statement, two individuals named Omar Al-Muwahid and Saifullah Mujahid detonated themselves in two suicide operations among a gathering of Iranian people around the tomb of Martyr General Qasem Soleimani, resulting in 300 deaths and injuries.

It is worth mentioning that on Wednesday, as a result of two terrorist explosions during the fourth commemoration anniversary of Martyr Soleimani in Kerman, 84 people were martyred and more than 280 others were injured.

Although the ISIS terrorist group has taken responsibility for this attack, experts believe that this does not change the essence of the matter.

▫️The use of terrorism and terrorist groups has been a constant tool for the western intelligence systems, especially the Israeli regime, to strike the opponent and disrupt the stability and national security of the opposing party. A clear example of this issue has been observed in recent years in Syria. The United States and the Israeli regime have openly and covertly used various extremist groups and movements to inflict significant blows and casualties on the government and people of Syria. Therefore, the terrorist attack in the southeastern city of Kerman can be defined as part of this very plot.

As a result of the US terrorist army’s drone attack on the positions of the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU) in eastern Baghdad, two members of the Iraqi resistance forces were martyred, and six others were injured.

During the drone attack on the logistical support headquarters of the Popular Mobilization Units near the Iraqi Police Academy and east of capital city Baghdad, the commander of the 12th Brigade of the Popular Mobilization Units and the military official of the Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba Movement in Iraq Hajj Musghtaq Talib al-Saadi along with his assistant, were martyred.

The United States’ terrorist forces carried out this attack by firing four missiles, three of which were launched at once, and the fourth missile hit the vehicle carrying al-Saadi.

The US drone attack comes as Sheikh Akram al-Kaabi emphasized during a speech in Tehran’s Grand Mosque on Wednesday that if the American occupiers do not leave Iraq, the Iraqi resistance will take unprecedented actions against the US.

▫️As mentioned earlier, the Israeli regime and its eternal ally, the United States, have begun a new round of assassinations and physical removal of influential commanders and individuals of the Islamic resistance axis by the use of division of labor. It seems that unfortunately, the scale of assassinations may increase if a decisive response is not received, and the US and the Israeli regime may push the region towards a widespread confrontation.

🔰 The Terrorist Attack In Kerman Will Be Met With Harsh Response: Iran’s Supreme Leader

▫️Leader of the Islamic Revolution, Imam Khamenei, has issued a message following the martyrdom of a number of pilgrims who were martyred in a terrorist attack while en route to the tomb of Martyr General Soleimani in Kerman’s Garden of Martyrs on January 3, 2024. The following is the text of this message.

In the Name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful

The evil, criminal enemies of the Iranian nation once again created a disaster and martyred a large number of our dear people in Kerman in the fragrant atmosphere of the Martyrs’ tombs.

The Iranian nation is in grief, and many families are mourning the death of their loved ones. The hard-hearted criminals could not tolerate the love and enthusiasm of the people for visiting the tomb of their great commander, Martyr Qasem Soleimani. Let them know that the soldiers who are traveling on the bright path of Soleimani will not tolerate their vileness and crime. As of now, both the hands stained with the blood of innocent people and the corrupt and evil minds that led them to this error will definitely be the target of a severe pounding and a deserving retribution. Let them know that, God willing, this disaster will be met with a hard response.

I sympathize and am with the bereaved families, and I pray for their patience and consolation from Almighty God. The pure souls of these martyrs will, God willing, be the guests of the “Lady of Two Worlds,” the “Mother of the Martyrs,” Lady Siddiqah Tahirah [Fatimah Zahra] (peace be upon her). I would also like to extend my sympathies to those who were injured in this tragedy, and I pray to God for their healing.

🔰 Yemeni Forces Target Ship Heading Towards Israeli Port: Yemen Army Spokesman

▪️According to Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman for the Yemeni armed forces, the Yemeni Navy attacked the CMA CGM TAGE container ship that was heading towards the Israeli occupied ports. This operation was carried out after the crew of the ship ignored warnings from the Yemeni Navy, including firing warning messages.

▫️The Yemeni armed forces emphasized in the statement that as long as the necessary food and medicine for the Palestine people do not reach the Gaza Strip, they will continue to prevent Israeli ships or ships heading towards the Israeli-occupied ports from passing through the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea.

▫️The Yemeni armed forces also added that any US aggression will not go unanswered and unpunished. The Yemeni armed forces warned the US enemy and others against any attack or action that shows protection of Israeli commercial ships.

🔰 Over 80 Martyred In Terrorist Attack On Martyrdom Anniversary Of Gen. Soleimani In Kerman + Video

▪️As a result of two terrorist explosions during the commemoration ceremony of martyr General Qassem Soleimani in the Iranian city of Kerman, at least 84 people were martyred and more than 280 others were injured.

Wednesday afternoon, around 3:00 pm local time, two large explosions were heard in the southeastern city of Kerman. According to official reports, the first explosion occurred in an underpass near the Jabaliyeh historical Dome and the second blast took place at the entrance gate of Qoli Beig Mosque near Imam Zaman Mosque, targeting people who were gathered at Shohada cemetery in Kerman to mark General Soleimani’s fourth martyrdom anniversary.

It should be noted that these explosions occurred outside the path of pilgrims and inspection gates.

At first, it was said that these blasts were carried out by two suicide bombers, but shortly after, it was announced that two bomb-laden bags were remotely detonated by the perpetrators of this terrorist attack.

According to the latest information(14:00 - Jan 4), 84 people have been martyred and 284 others have been injured as a result of the explosions so far. Given the severity of the incident, there is a possibility of an increase in the number of martyrs.

▫️This is the fourth anniversary of the martyrdom of the resistance legend, Lieutenant General Qassem Soleimani. A commemoration, which was participated by numerous people from all over Iran, who took part enthusiastically in this ceremony, the same way they participated in previous years. Given the tense situation in the West Asia region and the events that we are witnessing these days in Palestine and at the regional level, and the assassination of senior commanders of the Islamic resistance axis such as the slaying of Iranian military advisor Martyr Seyed Razi Mousavi in Syria as well as Palestinian resistance commander Sheikh Saleh al-Arouri in Lebanon by the Israeli regime, it was predictable that we would witness similar events even in other countries.

▫️Clearly, the criminal regime of Israel has openly and blatantly started a chain of assassinations against the commanders of the resistance axis and a chain of terrorist and security operations against civilians and important facilities. The Israeli regime is currently in its worst security situation since its establishment and feels severely threatened. Experience has shown that in such situations, assassination and destruction have always been one of the main tactics of the Israeli regime to achieve its goals. Wednesday’s terrorist operation in the Iranian city of Kerman has also been blatantly done based on the same tactic, and the footprint of the Israeli regime is clearly visible in this heinous act.

◾️It seems that with the continuation of crimes and terrorist operations, the Israeli regime is inevitably pushing the region towards a all-inclusive and extensive conflict.

For the West, Israel is now a strategic liability. Israel’s leaders would readily sacrifice our interests to achieve their goals of ethnically cleansing Palestine and dominating the Middle East. 

Israel’s former PM and unrepentant war criminal Naftali Bennett is now openly demanding that the U.S. and its allies attack Iran. Not only would a war with Iran cause devastating death and destruction, it would also result in massive damage to the global economy and consume huge amounts of public money that could be used to better the lives of the citizens of Western nations.

Bennett and other Israeli leaders want us to fight their war for them because (a) they cannot defeat Iran by means of conventional warfare and (b) they could not care less about the lives of our soldiers and citizens.

The simplest and most humane way to bring peace to the Middle East is for Israel to agree to the creation of a viable and truly sovereign Palestinian state along the 1967 borders - which is what the United Nations has demanded for decades. These racist lunatics would rather plunge the West into another catastrophic war than respect the will of the international community and the human rights of the Palestinian people.

To say it again, Israel is not our friend. Israel is our enemy.

🔰 Latest Military Situation In The Gaza Strip; 86th Day Of Battles (Map)

▫️Review of the latest military situation in the northern and southern fronts of the Gaza Strip after 86 days of fighting.

▪️In the northern axis of the Gaza Strip, clashes continue in Jabalia refugee camp and central areas of the Gaza city, as well as in some areas of Sheikh Radwan, Al-Tuffah, and Al-Daraj. The Israeli regime’s military forces have been slowly advancing in the central part of the Gaza City over the past four days, clearing areas and creating new pockets of encirclement. In case this trend continues, it appears that the central areas of the Gaza City will soon come under complete control of the occupying Israeli army. In the Beit Lahia axis, the Israeli regime’s military forces have been advancing in the northern part of the region.

▪️In the central axis of the Gaza Strip, Israeli military forces have entered Al-Bureij refugee camp for about four days and have expanded the scope of their advance. Currently, intense fighting is ongoing inside Al-Bureij refugee camp and to the east of Al-Maghazi town. It seems that the Israeli regime’s army intends to first fully occupy Al-Bureij camp and then move on to Al-Maghazi town and Al-Nusairat camp.

▪️In the southern axis of the Gaza Strip, over the past week, the Israeli regime’s military forces have been slowly but continuously advancing in the urban area of Khan Yunis city and its outskirts.

In the southern outskirts of Khan Yunis in the Khuza’a axis, Israeli military forces have increased their scope of advance to some extent. In the eastern outskirts of Khan Yunis, in the Al-Sureij and Al-Qarara areas, the Israeli regime’s forces have advanced from two directions, completely occupied the Al-Sureij area, and tightened the encirclement of the Al-Qarara area. Partial advances have also been made towards Salah al-Din Street in western Bani Suhaila.

In the northern part of Khan Yunis, Israeli forces have expanded their scope of advance towards the north and occupied more areas. In this axis, the Israeli regime’s army has literally destroyed Khan Yunis and nearly half of its eastern and northeastern parts have been wiped off the map! A comparison and examination of satellite images before and after the ongoing invasion by the Israeli regime’s occupying forces in this area clearly shows that farms and urban structures have been deliberately destroyed and leveled by heavy bombardments and then by Israeli bulldozers.

The fourth boat escaped from the area. No harm was done to US personnel or equipment during the confrontation.

▪️Yemeni officials have not yet responded to the US statement or the previous statements from the US army.

▪️Yemeni authorities also emphasized that there is no threat to international shipping security, and US claims and actions will lead to an escalation of conflicts in the region. The formation of the US-led coalition under the name of Operation Prosperity Guardian is aimed at supporting the Israeli regime and continuing the war in the Gaza Strip.

🔰 Spokesperson of Ansar Allah: The Membership Of Some Countries In The US-Led Maritime Coalition Is Not Real

Mohammed Abdul-Salam, the spokesman of Ansar Allah and the chief negotiator of Yemen’s National Salvation Government of Yemen, in an interview with Euronews: “International waterlines are safe and stable, and hundreds of ships cross the Red Sea every day. The confusion of some countries that are being pressured by the US to join the maritime coalition stems from the fact that this coalition is illegal. The Yemeni navy communicates with all ships daily and the US is trying to provoke some countries to join the “coalition to support Israel”. We are in contact with countries from this coalition that have confirmed that they are not present at sea, and some of them informed us that their presence in the coalition is limited to sending troops to Bahrain.“

The diplomatic contacts of the countries participating in the US maritime coalition with Ansar Allah officials show that the military power of this coalition is limited to the frigates of the United States, Britain and Israel, and the membership of other countries is for show. These countries are both afraid of Ansar Allah’s attacks and cannot tolerate the US pressure. The history of contemporary wars has proven that the slave and mercenary countries have always suffered the most losses.

Anti-armor missiles can be considered the most important weapon of this war, especially in the southern front of Lebanon. The dual launcher version of this effective weapon was also made by the Iranians and similar variants are available to Hezbollah. Of course, the main goal of this version is to attack Israeli tanks and armored vehicles equipped with trophy systems, but this attack showed that sometimes you can count on the stupidity of Israeli soldiers and shoot the second missile at them."

🔰 Latest Military Situation In The Gaza Strip; 81th Day Of Battles (Map)

Review of the latest military situation in the northern and southern fronts of the Gaza Strip after 81 days of fighting.

▪️In the northern axis of Gaza Strip, according to the latest field information and videos released by field sources, the Israeli regime forces have retreated from Beit Hanoun and most of Beit Lahia, but the clashes continue around Jabalia and some areas of Sheikh Radwan. Also, Israeli forces have retreated from some places in Al-Shujaiyah area. On the other hand, the Israeli forces entered the Gaza Strip from two new axes from the south of Jabalia and reached the Israeli forces in the west of the Jabalia camp and tightened the siege of the Jabalia camp.
It should be noted that until the moment of writing this text, the news of the complete withdrawal of the Zionist regime from the areas of Al-Rimal, Al-Zaitun, Al-Shujaiyah and other areas of Gaza City is not true and Israeli forces are present in different areas of the city. The map of the Gaza Strip will be updated or corrected if reliable field information of new changes is received.

▪️In the central axis of the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces have entered the Gaza Strip from south of Al-Bureij during the last four days. Also, Israeli forces have taken control of most of Al-Maghraqa and have made advances in Juhr Al-Dik area. Currently, the most intense clashes are going on near Bureij and Nuseirat. In general, the middle front of the Gaza Strip is now the most active front of the strip.

▪️In the southern axis of the Gaza Strip, there has been no significant change in the Khan Yunis front, and the control lines in this city have not changed compared to recent days.

In the first days of the Israeli regime's military aggression against Khan Yunis, the Bani Suheila area was one of the first focus points of the Zionist regime's attacks. During the news report of the clashes, it was stated that the regime forces have approached the main square of this area, but they are having a difficult time to capture it. Now, after more than two weeks of fighting, the area of Bani Suheila has not been completely occupied. The volume of clashes and crazy bombings on Bani Suhaila has been so high that Alam Square and its surrounding areas have turned black! The traces of heavy bomb craters of the Israeli regime can also be clearly seen on the image.

🔰 US Army Claims Ansar Allah Conducted Unsuccessful Attacks; Ansar Allah Denied

The United States Central Command (CENTCOM) issued a statement on December 23 claiming that four missile and drone attacks by Yemen’s Ansar Allah movement against Israeli or Israel-bound vessels in the southern Red Sea were repelled and unsuccessful attempts.

The claims made by the US while the Yemeni authorities denied these attacks. Mohammed Abdul-Salam, the spokesman of Ansar Allah and the chief negotiator of Yemen’s National Salvation Government, denied these claims.

Abdul-Salam said: “While a reconnaissance drone of the Yemeni army was conducting reconnaissance operations in the Red Sea, an American frigate fired frantically at it with multiple weapons. This action shows their state of confusion and anxiety. One of the missiles fired by the American frigate exploded near a ship belonging to Gabon, which was moving from the source of Russia to the south of the Red Sea.“

He added, “We emphasize that the militarization of the Red Sea by the United States and its allies is a threat to international maritime navigation. If the US and its allies continue on their bully path, the Red Sea will become a burning zone and the countries bordering the Red Sea must realize the reality of the dangers that threaten their national security.“

Military and political officials from the Yemeni National Salvation Government have repeatedly emphasized that the Yemeni forces’ attacks will be communicated solely through statements by Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces, and other countries’ claims do not hold any official recognition.

🔰 Naval Operations By Yemeni Armed Forces Against Israeli Interests In Red Sea, Bab Al-Mandab Strait

▪️From November 19, the Yemeni armed forces kicked off naval operations against Israeli vessels and those affiliated with the regime in the Red Sea and the Bab al-Mandab Strait. These operations have resulted in the seizure of one ship, diversion of at least two vessels, and attacks on at least 11 ships. (till 23 Dec)

▪️Among the outcomes of these operations against Israeli shipping, there are significant financial losses inflicted on Israeli companies and economic ministries, a reduction in the activity of Israeli ports, and the halt of Israeli ships’ passage through the Red Sea, among many other consequences. These attacks have also led to the suspension of cooperation with the Israeli regime by at least seven major shipping companies, which is of great importance.

▪️The Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea are vital economic arteries, which the Ansar Allah movement and the Yemeni army have managed to control through their resistance and precise attacks. Yemen’s role in the resistance axis against the Israeli regime and its Western allies has become prominent to a certain extent, to the point where Western media have claimed that US officials have proposed halting the Yemeni forces’ attacks in exchange for achieving a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and sending humanitarian aid through mediating countries.

🔰 Israeli Casualties Are Increasing, Eight More Soldiers Were Killed In Gaza

▪️The Israeli army admitted to death of eight more of its soldiers in the Gaza Strip and northern occupied Palestine. These eight servicemen were killed during the conflict with the Palestinian resistance forces in the central and southern areas of the Gaza Strip.

▪️It is said that four of these servicemen were killed by an ATGM missile hitting an armored personnel carrier in the south of the Gaza Strip, two of them were killed in a rigged house in the center of the Gaza Strip, and two others were killed by an attack on a Hummer in the center of the Gaza Strip.

▪️With the death of these three servicemen, according to the official announcement, the alleged death toll of the Israeli army since the launch of ground invasion of Gaza has increased to 152 servicemen, And the alleged total number of “military” deaths since the October 7 reached 485 servicemen.

▪️In recent days, the casualties of the Israeli regime have increased dramatically. The increase in casualties of the Israeli regime affects the possibility of ending the war in Gaza. In general, Israelis do not tolerate casualties, and if these casualties continue, the pressure of public opinion in the occupied territories will lead to changes in the decision-making process of Israel’s military leaders.

Similarity of Israel and ISIS in hostility to Islam and destruction of mosques!

The recently released videos of the Zionist army blowing up and targeting mosques in the Gaza Strip or stripping civilians are reminiscent of ISIS behavior in Iraq and Syria in the past years.

Considering these actions, if the ISIS terrorist group had an air force, it would be completely similar to the Israeli regime; Even now, considering the recent crimes committed by the Zionists in Gaza, there is a lot of similarity between this regime and ISIS..."

🔰 Latest Military Situation In The Gaza Strip; 78th Day Of Battles (Map)

▪️In the northern areas of the Gaza strip, scattered clashes continued along the axes of the Jabalia camp as well as around Al-Jalaa Street and Yarmouk Street. Also, Israeli forces carried out attacks against the areas of Al-Tuffah and Al-Daraj on Saturday.

Based on field information, it appears that Israeli forces have withdrawn from some points in the Gaza City. This withdrawal does not mean a complete withdrawal from the city; rather, the Israeli troops moved between several areas, several lines, or several streets. Generally, the Israeli regime’s army has established several points in the city as its main command center and from these areas, it advances or moves its forces to maintain control over the occupied areas.

It seems that the evacuation of some areas by the Israeli regime has been done for three reasons; first, the Israeli regime has achieved some of its goals, such as controlling key areas of the city of Gaza and destroying some of the most important tunnels and sections, both through aerial bombardment and through bombing and destruction. The second reason is that the prolongation of the war and the significant increase in casualties in recent days have forced them to make these withdrawals. The Israeli regime is forced to restrict or reduce the battlefronts in the Gaza City to prevent further casualties. And the third reason is that for now, the Israeli regime’s army has confined itself to its current conquests in the Gaza City and is now seeking to occupy the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip.

Another important incident, which happened on Saturday, was the bombing of the Al-Shati refugee camp. After the initial advances of the Israeli regime’s forces in the Gaza City, the Al-Shati area was one of the first areas to be cut off from other parts of the city, and since then, no news has been reported from this area. However, the bombing of the Al-Shati refugee camp showed that the Israeli regime does not have complete control over this area. Also, an Israeli media outlet revealed for the first time on Saturday that over the course of the recent advances by the Israeli regime’s army, its forces did not fully enter Al-Shati refugee camp due to fear of heavy casualties and instead besieged this area.

▪️In the middle of the Gaza Strip, clashes have intensified. According to field information, the Israeli regime’s military forces have launched new operations from Al-Mughraqa town, Al-Zahra, and Juhor ad-Dik village, and they are trying to advance towards Al-Bureij and Al-Nuseirat refugee camp. At this time, intense clashes are taking place in the Al-Mughraqa area. The Israeli regime’s warplanes are also heavily bombing the central areas of the Gaza Strip. So far, the Israeli regime’s military forces have not succeeded in making significant advances in this axis.

▪️In the south of the Gaza Strip, scattered clashes continue in Khan Yunis city, and there has been no significant change in the control lines of this city.

🔰 Anti-US Operations Not To Stop: Secretary-General Of Al-Nujaba

▪️Sheikh Akram Abbas al-Ka’abi, founder and Secretary-General of Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba (HHN) in Iraq, addressed Iraqi groups, noting that if you do not support the resistance; then, stop standing with the enemies.

▪️Sheikh Akram Abbas al-Ka’abi also went on to say that whenever the resistance is on the verge of victory and succeeds in humiliating the United States, the cries of some people have become so loud that it is not possible to determine whether the US does not intend to withdraw its military forces from Iraq or they do not want the occupying forces to pull out.

▪️The resistance commander also warned that they have paid political lip service to continue supporting the US, and this attempt is based on distortion of reality to show their submission. It has reached a point that we have to say that we do not want any support from you in advocating the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, but only and only do not be in the camp of the enemies of Iraq (our enemies and your foes)!

▪️Al-Ka’abi concluded that in any case, the enemy’s tricks and tactics do not deceive us. The resistance never stops military operations; except when the sound of victory is heard with the permission of Almighty God. Neither cessation, nor compromise, and nor retreat.

▪️It is worth mentioning that after the onset of the battle between the Israeli regime and Palestinian resistance movement, some Iraqi resistance groups began a series of attacks against the forces supporting the Israeli regime in the region, namely American terrorist forces of CENTCOM in Iraq and Syria since October 18, which has continued up to now.

▪️In addition to these strikes, Iraqi resistance groups have carried out at least six direct attacks against the occupied territories and positions of the Israeli regime.

🔰 Israeli Military Advisors Arrive In Socotra Island On UAE Plane 

▪️According to local media reports, a group of Israeli officers entered the Socotra Island in southern Yemen as part of a joint plan between the Israeli regime, the United States, the United Arab Emirates, and Saudi Arabia to protect Israeli shipping in Yemeni waters. 

▪️The Emirati plane carried a group of Israeli military advisors and Emirati intelligence officers. After landing, the Israeli and Emirati advisors went to the new Emirati military base on the Socotra Island. 

▪️This move follows the publication of reports by some Israeli media outlets about the entry and deployment of the Sa'ar 6-class corvette on the Socotra Island. The Sa'ar 6-class corvette was recently deployed to the Red Sea for the first time. 

▪️No information has been released about the mission of this small warship and the Israeli advisors in Socotra Island, but given the defensive nature of the Sa'ar 6-class corvette, it is likely that the Israeli regime intends to establish a naval base on this island with the help of the UAE and its other allies, and Sa'ar 6-class corvette is tasked with protecting the base. 

▪️Socotra is the most important and largest island in Yemen’s territorial waters in the Gulf of Aden, which plays a crucial role in controlling the waters of southern Yemen. This island had been previously used as a naval and military base by Britain and Portugal and has recently been handed back and forth between Emirati and Saudi mercenaries.

The Israeli army completely demolished several residential blocks around Palestine Square located in the Al-Rimal area in the west of Gaza City.

The Israeli army claims that this action was taken after the discovery of set of Hamas tunnels and buildings.

This area was a civilian block where there was a hospital, a mosque, and several educational, medical, and service institutions, including the Gaza Civil Registry Office. The complete and indiscriminate destruction of residential areas and extensive bombings by Israel is a clear example of a war crime, but the international communities are silent about these crimes.

""We are not the ones who will take action after the enemy’s attack, we are the people who reject oppression, rely on God, and are not afraid of US threats and direct attacks. We are not among those who surrender to the threat of direct war with the United States. The US has mobilized regional countries to fight us, mobilized Takfiri militants to engage us, and committed the most heinous crimes against our people. We have been affected by the wars that the Americans have launched against us through their agents in the region.

🔰 US Plans To Create New Naval Coalition In Red Sea

During his ongoing trip to the West Asia region, the United States Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin intends to announce the creation of a new naval coalition called “Operation Prosperity Guardian” involving several countries. The aim of this naval coalition is to counter the actions of the resistance axis against the Israeli regime, particularly the Yemeni armed forces, in the Red Sea.

This coalition is similar to the Combined Task Force 153, which was formed in April 2022 to ensure security in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden as well as counter threats from the resistance axis in Yemen.

It is currently unclear which countries will participate in the new naval coalition and what the extent of its operations entails.

A US military official has claimed that the USS Carney destroyer, with the help of the Royal Navy destroyer HMS Diamond, recently shot down 14 drones launched from Yemen. The US official refrained from providing further details about that attack, as it could potentially reveal information about the ammunition reserves of US destroyers.

At present, about one-sixth of the world’s commercial ships pass through the Bab al-Mandab Strait and the Red Sea. In response to Israel’s brutal attacks on the Gaza Strip and the international community’s inaction, the Yemeni armed forces have announced that they will attack Israeli ships and those affiliated with Zionist companies.

This threat, along with the seizure of the Galaxy Leader ship and the attack on at least 12 other ships, has put significant pressure on the Israeli naval fleet, to the point where most shipping companies refrain from cooperating with the Israeli regime and have suspended their activities in the Red Sea.

🔰 Yemen Army Carries Out Drone Attacks On Two Ships In Red Sea

▪️Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesperson for the Yemeni Armed Forces, has revealed details of Monday’s operation by the Yemeni army against two foreign-flagged vessels believed to be affiliated to Israel.

▪️In a military operation using two suicide drones, the Yemeni Navy targeted two ships associated with the Israeli regime, which were sailing in the Red Sea.

▪️According to Brigadier General Yahya Saree’s statement, the Atlantic Swan tanker and the MSC Clara container ship were hit by two suicide drones. The attack on these two ships occurred after their crew refrained from responding to calls from the Yemeni Navy.

▪️In this statement, the Yemeni armed forces reassured all foreign ships other than those heading towards Israeli ports that they would not be harmed and should keep their GPS tracking devices active.

▪️The Yemeni armed forces also emphasized that they would not hesitate to target Israeli ships and those affiliated with the regime, and they would prevent the movement of any ships, regardless of their nationality, destined for Israeli ports until the required food and medicine reach the people of the Gaza Strip.

▪️According to the analysis by The IWN, this is the eleventh official naval operation by the Yemeni army against Israeli ships or Israel-bound vessels in the Red Sea and the Arabian Sea, and so far, more than 13 Israeli ships and those affiliated with this regime have been attacked or captured by the Yemeni armed forces.

Although with the current conditions of the battle in Gaza City, the use of Kornet is very difficult and challenging, but it seems that the resistance fighters will use this weapon more to cause more casualties to the Israeli army."

Al-Qassam Brigades: You are late! Mission accomplished!

Al-Qassam Brigades released a remix video of the discovery of resistance tunnels near the border of the Gaza Strip and the presence of Yoav Gallant and Israeli forces inside the tunnels and scenes from the first day of the battle. 

In fact, by broadcasting this video, the Palestinian resistance sends the message that the operations have been carried out both from inside the tunnels and from outside the tunnels, And now you are already late!

Yesterday, after the video of the tunnels was broadcast, Israeli military sources claimed that Hamas did not use these tunnels in the October 7 attack and that this network of tunnels was probably built for other strategic operations.

The tunnel that Israel unveiled yesterday was only a small part of the tunnel network in the Gaza Strip. This tunnel is completely isolated and its length hardly reaches 1500 meters in a straight line. Clearly, the Zionists have understood well by now how difficult it will be to actually capture the Gaza Strip...

The Zionist regime set a new page of crime in the history of mankind!

Today, the bulldozers of the criminal Israeli regime destroyed parts of the building and yard of Kamal Adwan Hospital, located in the north of the Jabalia camp, along with the patients and wounded inside!

This hospital, like other hospitals, is a place full of Palestinian refugees, and the Palestinian refugees' accommodation tents were located in the yard of this hospital.

According to eyewitnesses, many people were buried alive in this horrible crime. The bodies of the patients are still buried under the rubble and many others are missing.

The Minister of Health of Gaza has called for an international investigation into this unprecedented crime by the soldiers of the Israeli regime. 

Just imagine if ""one"" of these events happened by the opponents of the US and the West, how they would attack it with all the media and the so-called international and human rights organizations, but they are blind and deaf to the clear and shameless crimes of the Zionist regime!!

Comparison Of Casualties Of children, Women In Gaza, Ukraine Wars

▪️In the past 70 days, as a result of the Israeli regime’s attacks on the Gaza Strip, more than 18,787 Palestinians, including 7,870 children and more than 6,000 Palestinian women, have been killed, and more than 50,897 others have been injured. However, during the 660 days of the war between Russia and Ukraine, more than 10,749 civilians and about 550 children have lost their lives.

▪️In other words, the number of civilian casualties in Gaza in just 70 days has been higher than the entire Russia-Ukraine war in 660 days!!

▪️The World Health Organization (WHO) had announced a few days ago that about five children in Gaza are killed every hour.

▪️The comparison of the number of children and women killed in the Gaza war with the conflict in Ukraine clearly indicates the extent and severity of the heinous crimes of the Israeli regime against the people of Palestine and is a clear example of the inefficiency of the United Nations.

▪️According to the available information, one of these ships was attacked by a missile in the north of Mocha port and caught fire, and one of its containers fell into the sea.

▪️Hours later, the Yemeni Armed Forces took responsibility for the attack on the ships by publishing a statement.

▪️In this statement, Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces, said: “With the help of God, in two operations, we attacked two ships, MSC Alanya and MSC PALATIUM III, which were moving towards Israel, with two missiles. This operation took place after the crews of these ships refused to respond to the calls of the Yemeni Navy and also to the warning messages. We will not hesitate to target any offending vessel that we have mentioned in previous statements. Until the arrival of food and medicine to the Gaza Strip, we will prevent the entry of all ships bound for Israeli ports. Our operation continues until the victory of the oppressed people of Palestine and is in line with the implementation of the orders of our leader and answering the call of our people and Muslims.”

▪️These two ships are the 9th and 10th Israeli ships, either affiliated with Israeli companies or destined for Israel, to be attacked by the Yemeni army. By continuing the attacks against the criminal ships, the Yemeni army clearly conveys this message to the world that the Yemeni people will continue their attacks until the end of the siege and the war in Gaza, and that the military threats of the United States and other western powers have no effect on reducing or stopping the attacks. The war in Gaza must stop and the siege of the people of Gaza must end.

🔰 US Claims Ansar Allah Attacks On Commercial Ships Unsuccessful

Israeli media outlets, citing a US official, who claimed that Yemen’s Ansar Allah movement had attacked a commercial ship with two missiles in the Bab el-Mandeb Strait this morning, but the attack was unsuccessful.

The ship was operating under the flag of the Marshall Islands and carried some armed crew, while sailing from India towards the Suez Canal (possibly Israeli ports).

Furthermore, a US Navy destroyer succeeded in shooting down a suspected drone in the skies over the Red Sea.

The United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) also reported two incidents and suspicious activities near the Bab el-Mandeb Strait and the coasts of Oman, supporting the claim made by Israeli media outlets.

Despite these allegations, Yemeni armed forces have not made any statement on this issue so far.

▪️Yesterday, according to the Israeli regime, 10 of its forces were killed in the Gaza Strip. Nine of these servicemen were killed in the battles of Shujaiyah in an ambush by the Palestinian Resistance forces, and another serviceman was killed in another battle in the north of the Gaza Strip. 

▪️These servicemen are from the famous Golani Brigade and Special Tactics Rescue Unit 669.

▪️Acknowledging the killing of nine servicemen by a regime that always tries to hide its casualties is not a simple matter, And ironically, it is very important. Shujaiyah conflict is one of the most difficult battles, or rather, the most difficult possible battle for the Israeli regime. Due to the difficulty of the battles, the amount of casualties is so high that the Israeli army is forced to announce some deaths in order to make the casualties appear normal.

The Norwegian tanker, Strinda, was attacked precisely by a missile after disobeying the Yemeni Navy’s order to change course towards the western shores of Yemen.

According to Western media reports, a ship was attacked by a Yemeni cruise missile and caught fire in the Red Sea.

Brigadier General Yahya Saree, spokesman for the Yemeni Armed Forces, said: ""In a military operation, the Yemeni Navy targeted the Norwegian ship Strinda, which was carrying a cargo of oil towards Israel, with an appropriate naval missile.""

The Yemeni brigadier general added that the Yemeni Armed Forces have succeeded in preventing several ships from passing over the past two days.

These ships responded to warnings from the Yemeni Navy and were attacked when the crew of the Norwegian ship ignored the warnings.

The Yemeni Armed Forces will not back down from targeting ships mentioned in previous statements. We confirm that we will continue to prevent ships from any country traveling through the Red Sea and Arab waters towards Israeli ports until our brothers’ necessary food and medicine are allowed into Gaza.

Strinda is a Norwegian oil tanker that has been active since 2006 and carries oil and chemicals.

After announcing war against Israel, Abdul-Malik Badreddin al-Houthi, leader of the Ansar Allah movement, the Yemeni Armed Forces have carried out at least 11 missile and drone operations against Israeli positions in occupied southern Palestine.

The Israeli ship Galaxy Leader was also seized in the waters of the Red Sea, and about seven other ships belonging to Israeli companies or heading towards Israeli ports were attacked by Yemenis. Strinda is the seventh ship that has been carrying a cargo of oil towards the Suez Canal and an unknown port.

In this video, Israeli regime fighter jets attack a residential building in Gaza City with 'Spice 2000 bombs'. This bomb is one of the multi-purpose bombs that has a destructive effect through penetration, explosion and shrapnel and is mostly used to destroy enemy infantry positions.

But by examining the video, we find out that the Spice 2000 kits made by Israel were used on these bombs, and these kits are only used by the Israeli regime, so the attack was carried out by the Israelis, and the claim of the participation of US fighter jets is not true.

🔰 Yemen’s Army Attacked Two Ships In The Waters Of The Red Sea

▪️On December 3, the Unity Explorer ship, a Bahamas-flagged bulk carrier and the NUMBER 9 ship, a Panama-flagged container ship were attacked while crossing the Red Sea.

📝 The Yemeni armed forces released a statement about today’s attacks. Brigadier General Yahya Saree, Spokesman of the Yemeni Armed Forces:
“This morning, with the help of God Almighty, the Yemeni Navy attacked two Israeli ships named Unity Explorer and NUMBER 9 in Bab al-Mandab. The first ship was targeted by a missile and the second ship was targeted by a drone (suicide drone). The operation was carried out after two ships rejected warning messages from the Yemeni navy.
The Yemeni Armed Forces will continue to prevent the movement of Israeli ships in the Red and Arab seas until Israel’s aggression against our brothers in the Gaza Strip is stopped. The Yemeni Armed Forces had warned all Israeli ships or Israeli-affiliated ships that they would become a legal target if they violates what was issued in this statement and previous statements.”

▪️The US Army claims that its naval fleet moved towards the position of Israeli ships at 10:00 am today, and during a five-hour conflict, they confronted Ansar Allah’s missiles and drones. But it seems their actions have not been very effective in saving Israeli ships.

▪️In this regard, some Zionist media claimed that one of the ships that was hit by the drone was slightly damaged, but the other ship, part of which is also owned by the British, was hit by a cruise missile and severely damaged. This ship is currently stopped near the Bab al-Mandab Strait and reportedly will sink if immediate help does not reach it.

▪️The Yemeni Army and Ansar Allah control a large part of Yemen and maintain a large arsenal of missiles and drones. After the Israeli invasion of Gaza, the Yemeni Army launched several missile and drone attacks at targets in Israel. The Yemeni Army also seized Galaxy Leader, an Israeli-owned ship that was sailing towards the Bab al-Mandab Strait and allegedly attacked another ship with a suicide drone in the Indian Ocean.

▪️The Yemeni Army had halted operations against Israeli after a temporary ceasefire in Gaza entered into effect on November 24. A week later, they warned Israel that they will renew missile and drone attacks if the crimes against the people of Gaza were not stopped. With the resumption of war by Israel, now the Yemenis have resumed their attacks against Israel.

▪️According to this decision, Israeli ships will pass through the Strait of Gibraltar instead of the Suez Canal and the Red Sea, and will have to bypass the African continent.

▪️The decision of shipping companies to stop traffic from the Red Sea significantly lengthens the journey time of ships and increases its cost. This increase in costs will be added to the cost of transportation as well as the price of imported goods.

▪️In the long run, this problem increases the costs of the Israeli regime’s partner companies to a great extent and increases the economic pressure on Israel. A problem that seems to continue at least until the end of the Gaza war.

🔰 US Reiterates Anti-Yemen Claims That Ansar Allah Targets American Warship With Two Ballistic Missiles!


▪️After the United States claimed its military forces prevented the seizure of a chemical-carrying vessel in the Gulf of Aden by Yemen’s Ansar Allah movement, this time the Americans alleged that the Ansar Allah movement attacked a US-owned warship with two ballistic missiles.

▪️On Sunday, the United States resorted to a media propaganda campaign in collaboration with the United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations (UKMTO) and the Israeli regime’s media outlets, claiming that armed individuals attacked an oil tanker carrying chemical materials in the Gulf of Aden and made an emergency contact with this tanker.

▪️However, the armed attack was doomed to failure as a result of the timely reaction by the US Navy, and the tanker is currently out of harm’s way, the Westerners alleged. Moreover, five people have been arrested in regard of this incident, and no details of their identities have been released so far.

▪️In this respect, the United States Central Command (CENTCOM) once again claimed that the Ansar Allah movement attacked the position of an American warship in the Gulf of Aden with two ballistic missiles last night. It added that these two missiles landed within 10 miles (16 kilometers) of the American warship and caused no damage.

▪️Pentagon officials have announced to the US media outlets that they consider this incident as an escalation of tension and a major threat from the Ansar Allah movement.

▪️The United States’ allegations are being made while Yemeni authorities have rejected attempts to seize a ship in the Gulf of Aden.

▪️In addition, claims such as Ansar Allah’s maritime action in the Gulf of Aden and firing ballistic missiles at moving maritime targets are measures that are unprecedented during the eight-year war in Yemen and are not compatible with the field realities of Yemen! Although, the Ansar Allah movement possesses various cruise missiles and suicide drones at its disposal for targeting moving targets, especially the United States’ ships.

▪️Also, the coasts of the Gulf of Aden are not under the control of the Ansar Allah movement, and even if we assume the United States’ claim as true, when a ship is seized, it must travel about 400 kilometers to the port of Al Hudaydah.

🔰 Israeli Army Chief Vows To Resume Operations In Gaza Once Ceasefire Is Over

▪️On November 25, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant entered Gaza City in order to meet and discuss with Israeli commanders and forces stationed in the Gaza Strip.

▪️Gallant arrived in Gaza City by sea along with Commander of the Israeli Navy David Saar Salama.

▪️Gallant spoke about the method and process of seizing concessions from the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas.

▪️He said, “Our ability to bring the first group of hostages is due to the pressure applied by the army. As soon as military pressure is applied, they (Palestinian resistance) request a ceasefire. When you increase the pressure, they want another ceasefire. When you increase the pressure even more, they are ready to come up with a proposal (to give concessions), and when you increase the pressure even more than that, they are ready to come to us with a proposal that is acceptable to us. This is our entire approach (and working principles). We cannot leave the Gaza operation and war until we reach a situation where we return all hostages.”

▪️Gallant reiterated his previous war-mongering positions and emphasized: “The ceasefire will be short. Any further negotiations will take place under fire. This means that if they want to talk about the next agreement, these talks will take place while bombs are falling on them and our forces are at war. This is the foundation.”

▪️It is clear from Gallant’s statements that the Israeli regime intends to immediately resume military operations in the Gaza Strip after the current four-day ceasefire, which it was forced to accept due to international pressure; so, the regime plans to put more pressure on Palestinian resistance groups in order force them to surrender or give more concessions.

🔰 Israeli Regime Advances In Gaza City On The Eve Of The Ceasefire Agreement! (Map)

▪️In the past 24 hours, the Israeli regime occupying forces have advanced in several axes in Gaza City. These advances were made while the people of Gaza were preparing for a temporary ceasefire in the last two days, but this event was postponed every time.

▪️On the 48th day of the fighting, Israeli regime forces took full control of the southern part of the Rimal district in the center of Gaza City.

▪️In the north of Gaza City, Israeli forces took full control of the Atatara area and parts of Beit Lahia. The situation around the Indonesian hospital, as well as in the Beit Hanoun area, has not changed much.

▪️In the center of the Gaza Strip, Israeli forces succeeded in making small advances in the Al-Zahra area.

▪️Today, the bombings of different areas of the Gaza Strip continued.

▪️The 4-day ceasefire will start at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow, and according to the agreement, all ground battles will be stopped. Although it has been said that this ceasefire can be extended, but considering the successes that the Israeli regime has achieved in advancing in the west and north of Gaza City, it seems very unlikely that the Israeli regime will give up its occupation and new achievements easily. Probably, after these 4 days, they will start the military operation again in order to seize the remaining areas in the city. Therefore, the decisions, reactions and subsequent movements of the resistance axis in Palestine and even outside of it in these four days are very important and decisive.

This evening, the Yemeni armed forces carried out their 10th missile and drone operation against the Israeli regime positions in the Eilat region in the south of occupied Palestine.

According to the statement of Brigadier General Yahya Saree, the spokesman of the Yemeni armed forces, the missile force of the Yemeni army fired a batch of cruise missiles and attacked the Israeli positions in the area of Umm al-Rasharash (Eilat).

The Yemeni armed forces emphasized that the country’s military operations will continue until the end of Israel’s aggression against the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank.

According to the past attacks, Quds series missiles were probably used in this attack. These missiles managed to reach the occupied Palestinian territories by passing through the naval defense barrier created by the US Navy and also passing through the Saudi defense systems that help Israel. This incident shows the maturity of the Yemeni missile commanders in the use of cruise missiles, which was achieved as a result of their participation in the Palestinian war.

This morning, Hezbollah attacked the Biranit military base and the command center of the 91st division in northern Palestine with two heavy Burkan rockets.

The videos released from inside the Biranit base show the extensive destruction and effective strikes of Hezbollah’s Burkan rockets on this border base.

According to Hezbollah officials and media, the weight of the Burkan rocket varies between 300 and 500 kg, and its range is about 5 km. The explosion volume of this rocket is very high due to the heavy warhead and it causes heavy destruction in the border bases of Israel.

Undoubtedly, this attack is one of the heaviest attacks that Hezbollah has carried out on Israeli positions, and it is safe to say that such a scale of destruction has not been seen in Israel’s border bases so far.

The importance of this strike is clear because the Biranit base is the headquarters of the 91st division of the Israeli army and one of the oldest bases of the Zionists in the north of occupied Palestine. During the 33-day war and the conflicts of the last one month, this base was also attacked by Hezbollah rockets and artillery. But so far, it had not received such a blow. Biranit is located one kilometer from the occupied towns of Sasa and Netua, and its destruction or fall means easy access of the resistance forces to these two border settlement.

▪️ Heavy clashes between the Palestinian resistance groups and the Zionist regime continues in the axes of Al-Rimal, Al-Sheikh Radwan and Al-Tawam in the north of Gaza City.

▪️ The intensity of the attacks on the areas of Al-Zaytun and Tal Al-Hawa in the southwest of Gaza City has increased. According to the latest information, the Israeli forces have made advances in the mentioned axes. It seems that the Israeli military, with massive artillery and air support, intends to advance in these areas and create a new pocket in the south of Gaza city. On the other hand, today, the Israeli army also announced the expansion of its ground operations to all areas and axes, especially to the areas of Jabalia and Al-Zaytoun.

▪️ Israeli forces are advancing slowly in the axis of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun. Currently, the Israeli occupying forces control about 70% of Beit Hanoun.

▪️ Today in Beit Hanoun and west of Beit Lahia, Al-Quds Brigades fighters targeted a bulldozer and two Israeli tanks with RPG shells. These attacks show that despite the extensive air support and continuous artillery attacks against the resistance positions in Gaza, the Palestinian groups have succeeded to a large extent in maintaining their strength and military structure.

▪️ According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, the siege of Al-Ahli Arabi Hospital by Israeli army continues for the third day in a row. The areas around the hospital are witnessing intense aerial bombardments, and ground battles are also ongoing.

▪️ An interesting point is the continuation of rocket and drone attacks on the occupied territories by Al-Qassam Brigades. These attacks are carried out while Israeli aircraft bombardment and spy drones fly over different areas of the Gaza Strip 24 hours a day.

🔰 Intensification Of Clashes In The Western Axes Of Gaza

▪️Clashes between the resistance fighters and the Israeli regime forces have intensified since a few hours ago in the axes of Al-Rimal and Sheikh Al-Ajlin in the west of Gaza City.

▪️Israeli soldiers intend to advance in these areas with artillery and air support, but so far they have failed to achieve their goals due to the resistance by Palestinian fighters.

▪️It seems that the Zionist regime is planning to pressurize the fighters based in al-Shati area located in the west of Gaza city by advancing on the Ramal axis and increasing the attacks from the Sheikh Radwan axis and in some way to put this area under its siege. Yesterday, there were also rumors about the entry of Israeli armored vehicles into Ahmed Orabi Street along the coastline in the west of Al-Shati neighborhood.

A new video of Elizabeth Tsurkov, an Israeli spy, shows that she was working as an agent for Israeli and US spy agencies of Mossad and CIA to create division among the Shia Muslims in Iraq.

▪️On November 13, media outlets close to the Islamic Resistance of Iraq released a new video of Elizabeth Tsurkov who had disappeared in Iraq some time ago.

▪️In this video footage, Tsurkov said that I am an Israeli citizen and 37 years old. I left Israel and went to the United States. I was working for the Mossad and CIA. I was active in establishing relations between Israel and the Syrian Democratic Forces in northeastern Syria, and I had traveled there in 2022.

▪️She concluded by saying that I came to Iraq to serve the Mossad and CIA, and I have been in captivity for about 7 months now. I served Israel and I don’t think anything has been done for my freedom.

▪️Before her arrest, Tsurkov has been active on Twitter for over 15 years and openly supported wars and interventions against countries that the US and Israel consider their enemies, especially Syria. Despite the crimes of terrorist groups and opponents of the Syrian government, she helped to whitewash in favor of Syrian militants.

▪️According to her close friends, she was a former member of the Israeli army intelligence forces who participated in Israel’s 2006 war against Lebanon’s Hezbollah (33-day war). Tsurkov is also simultaneously a member of several Israeli think tanks and US institutions, including New Lines Institute.

▪️According to Egyptian sources, the United States diplomats have arrived in Cairo, the capital of Egypt, to negotiate with officials of the African country regarding a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of Israeli prisoners.

▪️The renewed trip comes as William Burns, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), had traveled to Egypt’s capital Cairo last week on November 7 to meet and talk with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi.

▪️According to senior Egyptian officials, during this meeting, the CIA chief had suggested to the Egyptian president that he can take charge of the security situation in the Gaza Strip until the Palestinian self-governing bodies are prepared to assume this responsibility.

▪️However, Sisi opposed any involvement in the developments in the Gaza Strip and emphasized that his government pursues relationship with Hamas in a bid to prevent the escalation of insecurity in the region.

▪️Considering the support of the US administration and military for Israeli atrocities and their attempt to prevent the approval of United Nations Security Council resolutions for a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip as well as the delivery of humanitarian aid to the besieged area, it seems that the issue of “ceasefire” has become their tool for the complete release of detainees held by Palestinian resistance groups, as well as for advancing their desirable plans for the Gaza Strip.

▪️The Egyptian authorities’ refusal to intervene in the developments in the Gaza Strip, as well as the proposing of a prisoner swap between Palestinian prisoners and Israeli detainees presented by Palestinian resistance movement, have caused several obstacles in the way of striking a deal and implementing ceasefire in this region.

🔰 Islamic Resistance Of Iraq Unveils New Missile

On November 14, the Islamic Resistance of Iraq issued a statement and released an image of the new ballistic missile dubbed Sarem.

The Islamic Resistance of Iraq emphasized in the statement that the missile was unveiled as part of the response to the Israeli regime’s war crimes against the Palestinians, which occurred under the guidance and management of the United States.

The images of the Sarem ballistic missile show that it is similar in size and shape to the Al-Aqsa 1 missile, both of which appear to be based on the same warhead design. Both unveiled missiles possess a combination of fins and a similar shape to the Fateh missile family.

Given the fact that the Islamic Resistance of Iraq has not yet announced the specifications of the two missiles officially, it seems to be difficult to determine their exact type. But, with a diameter of 368 mm, neither of the two examples can be the Fateh 360.

However, we can consider three possibilities for the two missiles Al-Aqsa 1 and Sarem.

In the first possibility, Al-Aqsa 1 could be a BM45 missile, and with the possibility of the existence of Al-Aqsa 2, another option must also be sought among the Fateh missile family. In this case, Sarem missile must be a BM250 missile.

But in the second possibility, Al-Aqsa 1 would be a Fateh-110 missile, and Sarem missile must be a Fateh-313 missile. However, the shape of the wings of the Sarem missile is similar to the Zolfaghar missile as well.

The third possibility is the production of exclusive missiles for the Islamic Resistance of Iraq, which may have been named and unveiled according to the needs of the time. In this case, the missiles only resemble Iranian models in appearance and may have significant changes to reduce costs while using the same engine.

It should be noted that the Islamic Resistance of Iraq had previously published an image on November 6 and unveiled another missile called Al-Aqsa 1.

The meeting of heads of Islamic and Arab countries regarding the latest developments in Palestine was held in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, on November 11.

Iranian President, Seyyed Ebrahim Raisi at the joint Islamic summit in Riyadh:

▪️Today is a historic day for the defense of Al-Aqsa Mosque. We want to make a historic and decisive decision about what is happening in the Palestinian territories.

▪️The US is complicit in Israel's crimes. Americans prefer the Zionist regime to the lives of thousands of oppressed people and encourage them to commit crimes against the oppressed.

▪️Today everyone has to decide which side to stand on.

▪️The worst role in the Gaza war is the role of America. America has practically entered the war in favor of Israel and sends many weapons shipments to Israel daily.

▪️I hope our meeting today will lead to the issuance of a resolution in favor of the Palestinian nation. We must immediately demand the withdrawal of the Zionist regime from Gaza. We must demand a cease-fire and complete lifting of the blockade of the Gaza Strip and the reopening of the Rafah crossing without restrictions or conditions.

▪️All countries, including Islamic countries, must ensure the security of Palestinians in the occupied territories.

▪️Trade and cooperation with the Zionist regime and the import of Israeli goods should be banned.

▪️We demand the formation of an international court for the Zionists and Americans involved in killing Gaza.

▪️Islamic countries should arm the Palestinian people.

▪️The sustainable solution to this crisis is to create a Palestinian state from the sea to the river. The passage of time is not beneficial and Israel must be confronted and the only solution is resistance.

▪️We send greetings to the resistant nation of Palestine and kiss the hands of the resistance.

▪️Muslims consider what is happening to be shameful for them, and if our meeting today does not have a result, it will cause the Islamic Ummah to despair.

🔰 Resistance Forces Conduct Out Simultaneous, Unprecedented Attacks Against United States’ Positions In Region; War In Gaza Must Be Stopped!

Iraqi resistance forces have carried out six attacks against the United States’ positions in Syria and Iraq from the late hours of Sunday night until this morning. These attacks included an attack on Qasrok military base, east of the town of Tel Tamr, in northeastern Syria, another attack on Ain al-Asad air base in western Iraq (first time), an attack on US army positions near Erbil airport in northern Iraq, an attack on Ain al-Asad base (second time), an attack on the Al-Tanf area in southern Syria, and an attack on Ain al-Asad base (third time).

The intensified attacks by the Iraqi resistance fighters against the United States’ positions are unprecedented, and the recent attacks are considered the heaviest and most widespread offensive by the Iraqi resistance against US military bases in Iraq and Syria in recent years.

These series of attacks took place after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s visit to the Iraqi capital Baghdad. Iraqi groups had previously announced that the visits of American officials into Iraq would not be welcomed! On Sunday, Antony Blinken arrived in Baghdad under tight security measures and met with the Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia’ al-Sudani for political talks. On Monday morning, Al-Sudani traveled to Tehran on an urgent trip!

Given al-Sudani’s trip to Tehran, it can be inferred that the Iraqi prime minister is conveying a new message from the United States to Iran.

As mentioned before, the attacks by the resistance groups will increase gradually and incrementally in proportion to the intensity and nature of the conflicts in the region. In addition to this trend, the type of reaction, behavior, and statements of US officials will also have an impact on these attacks. For instance, the recent attacks by the resistance groups on US positions in Iraq and Syria took place after US Secretary of State’s statements in Baghdad and the threats made by the resistance groups. Blinken had stated that we give a very clear message to those who threaten American soldiers and tell them not to do this.

It seems that the solidarity and coordination among the resistance groups in Iraq, Lebanon, Yemen, Palestine, and Syria, as well as the execution of joint attacks in northern Palestine and, on the other hand, in Iraq and Syria, have had a serious impact on United States’ stance towards the Israeli war of aggression against Gaza. The approximate simultaneity, volume, and type of attacks, which have been unprecedented in recent years, indicate that the axis of resistance has put the plan on its agenda to attack US bases in the region with controlled escalation in order to increase pressure on the forces supporting the Israeli regime in the region (i.e. CENTCOM forces) in proportion to the increasing pressures by the Zionist regime against the Gaza Strip.

According to local media reports, in a joint operation by forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s Ministry of Intelligence and Afghanistan’s Taliban intelligence agency, three individuals affiliated to the Israeli regime’s Intelligence Community Mossad were arrested in border areas of Afghanistan.

These individuals were Iranian nationals and intended to carry out attacks using suicide drones on Iranian soil and try to create discord between Iran and the Taliban.

It is also said that the Taliban caretaker government will soon transfer the detainees to Iran for interrogation.

The preparation and implementation of such terrorist plots are expected in the current crisis situation that the Israeli regime is facing. It is worth mentioning that Iranian nuclear facilities, military sites, and border areas can be targeted.

🔰 Multiple Flights Of Us Fuel Tanker Planes Over Saudi Arabian Airspace

▪️The ISWNEWS’ monitoring the status of flights in the region’s airspace shows that at least six US fuel tanker planes took off simultaneously over various parts of Saudi Arabia recently.

▪️Despite this volume of flights, it seems that these flights are related to attacks by Yemeni forces on the Israeli regime, and there are two general possibilities in this regard:
1- The monitoring of Yemeni launchers, which are used to launch missiles towards occupied Palestinian territories.
2- A maneuver to coordinate between Israeli and US air forces to retaliate Yemen’s strikes.

▪️It should be noted that these flights began after the crash of the Quds-3 cruise missile in Jordan that was recently launched by the Yemeni army.

▪️The most probable reason for these flights is the continuous monitoring of Saudi Arabia’s airspace to find cruise missiles and suicide drones fired by the Yemeni army.

▪️This monitoring will take place through continuous flights of Saudi and US fighter jets; so, it will increase the possibility of detecting and destroying missiles and drones fired by Yemen.

▪️This action, in addition to happening at the same time as the crash of the Yemeni cruise missile, also provides another possibility for the coalition the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel with the opportunity to pave the way for the Israeli air fleet to carry out an attack against Yemen in retaliation of recent missile strikes by the Yemeni army.

▪️Simultaneous flights of several fuel tankers at first glance give the impression that they are a coordinated maneuver for synchronized aerial movements, and however, this volume of fuel tankers seems excessive to cover a particular area where the possibility of missile and suicide drone passage exists. In any case, these actions indicate the creation of an undeclared coalition between the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Israel to save the Israeli regime.

🔰 Hezbollah Shot Down An Israeli Drone In Southern Lebanon

On November 5, Hezbollah’s air defense unit intercepted and destroyed an Israeli army drone in the sky of Nabatieh, located in southern Lebanon.

Before publishing this news, Hezbollah media published images of the interception of an Israeli Hermes 450 drone, but it seems that the wreckage of the downed drone in Nabatieh is more similar to the Israeli Heron 1 drone.

At the same time as this news, the Israeli army also claimed to shoot down a Hezbollah drone. Some media also attributed the images of Nabatieh to the downing of the Hezbollah drone.

In any case, it seems that Hezbollah’s claim in this case is more correct and can be confirmed.

🔰 Military Cooperation Between Arab States, Israel To Repel Ansar Allah Attacks!

The Israeli regime’s army has released a video of tracking and destroying a Yemeni cruise missile by an Israeli F-35 fighter jet. The cruise missile was heading towards southern occupied Palestine from Yemen on Wednesday, November 1, when it was shot down by an Israeli fighter jet.

According to images released by Yemeni armed forces, this missile is a Quds-3 cruise missile.

The noteworthy point in this video is the blatant cooperation of Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia with Israel to counter Yemeni army attacks. Undoubtedly, tracking and identifying this missile would not have been possible without the coordination of radar and defense systems of Saudi Arabian or Egyptian armies.

Continuous flights and patrols of Israeli fighter jets in the skies of the northern Red Sea are also not possible without using the airspace of Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Egypt. Therefore, the close relations between the governments of Arab countries with the United States and Israel are not just a claim but a reality.

🔰 Latest Military Developments Of Gaza And Palestine, 2 November 2023 (Map)

On the 27th day of fighting in Palestine, clashes between Palestinian fighters and Israeli army continued inside the Gaza Strip. The Zionist regime army continued its advance in the south of Al-Zaytun neighborhood in the south of Gaza City under the heavy air cover and reached Al-Rashid Street on the Gaza shore. Therefore, the southern routes of Gaza City were blocked and the siege of Gaza City was completed.

In the north of Gaza City, clashes continue in Al-Tawam(Toam) and Al-Karamah areas and near Al-Nasr Street. Also, clashes continue around Beit Hanoun. The advances of the Israeli army in these areas are very slow.

In general, most of the Israeli advances have been made in low-density and non-urban areas. The regime’s advances in urban and densely populated areas such as Beit Hanoun and Al-Tawam are carried out with difficulty. Therefore, it must be said that the main war, which is the urban war in Gaza city, will be very costly and harsh for Israel.

In addition to Israel’s ground attacks, the heavy bombardment of various areas of the Gaza Strip continues. The Palestinian Ministry of Health announced that the number of martyrs in Gaza has increased to more than 9257 people, of which more than 3826 are children and 2405 are women. Also, more than 23,516 have been injured.

On the northern front, artillery duels continue between Hezbollah and Israel, and no specific changes have been made in the front lines. An important event in this axis is Hezbollah’s use of suicide drones. For the first time during the last 27 days of fighting, Lebanon’s Hezbollah used two suicide drones to target Israeli positions in southern Lebanon. The use of suicide drones will open another page of battles in the southern fronts of Lebanon.

🔰 Hezbollah Shot Down The Second Israeli Drone

Lebanon’s Hezbollah announced in a statement on November 2: “The fighters of the Islamic resistance targeted an Israeli army drone in the sky of the village of Malikiah and Hunin with a surface-to-air missile. During this action, the Israeli drone was destroyed and fell in an unknown place.”

This is the second Israeli drone shot down by Hezbollah fighters in southern Lebanon in recent days. Previously, on October 30, Hezbollah targeted a drone over the southern regions of Lebanon in the east of Khiam.

It is worth mentioning that Israeli drones are one of the superiority of this regime over Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which has been fully revealed during the recent battle and the Zionist attacks on the southern regions of Lebanon. Therefore, Hezbollah must be able to shoot down more drones to solve this problem.

A review of the videos released by the Israeli army shows that the drones of this regime make countless flights over the southern regions of Lebanon to neutralize Hezbollah’s anti-armor units. Conducting continuous reconnaissance flights has increased the Israelis’ reconnaissance power and led to more precise attacks against Hezbollah. This issue is one of the main reasons for the recent increase in the number of Hezbollah martyrs in southern Lebanon.

🔰 Yemeni Ansar Allah’s Missile Fall In Jordan

According to residents of southern Jordan, one of the Yemeni Ansar Allah’s missiles fell in the Al-Mudawwara region during their third operation against Israeli positions on October 31.

Based on IWN  investigation, the missile is a Quds-3 cruise missile of the Ansar Allah movement of Yemen, which has a range of 1,700 kilometers.

The distance from the site of the missile’s fall in the Al-Mudawwara region in southern Jordan to the northern regions of Saada province in Yemen is about 1,500 kilometers.

This missile certainly reached the Al-Mudawwara region through an indirect route, so another 100 to 200 kilometers should be added to this distance. Therefore, it can be said that the ultimate target of the attack should be in close proximity to the location of the missile’s fall (Al-Mudawwara region).

The most important location in this area is the Ilan and Asaf Ramon International Airport (ETM) or the city of Eilat, about 100 kilometers away from the Al-Mudawwara region.

An important issue regarding this missile attack is the use of Saudi Arabia and Jordan’s airspace to attack Israel instead of the sea. Here, the Quds-3 missile travelled all through Saudi Arabia and entered Jordan soil without being identified, falling in the southern deserts of this country.

According to published images, there is no sign of a missile impact or explosion. Therefore, speculation about the destruction of the Yemeni missile by defense systems is ruled out, and a technical malfunction or fuel depletion due to traveling beyond the range limit is more likely.

The reason for not using the Red Sea route for this attack is also due to the presence of the US naval fleet in the north of this sea. By passing through various terrestrial obstacles, the possibility of identifying the missile by radars also greatly decreases, and practically, identifying the Quds-3 cruise missile for the US, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel in the Eilat area was not possible.

However, it should be mentioned that Israel and the United States’ chance of repelling attacks when the missile is near the occupied Palestinian airspace will increase because there are numerous radar equipment and defense systems in this area.

According to the statement of the Yemeni armed forces, their missile and drone attacks against Israel will continue. These attacks, especially those carried out with cruise missiles, pose a serious threat to the infrastructure of the Israeli regime, and the likelihood of hitting targets in the occupied territories of Palestine is higher than that of Zolfaghar ballistic missiles and Samad-4 suicide drones.

There is no detailed information about the results of these attacks, and according to video documentation, most of Ansar Allah’s attacks were repelled by Israel’s defense systems in cooperation with the US, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.

Statement issued by the Yemeni Armed Forces is as follow:

In the name of God, the most gracious, the most merciful
The Yemeni armed forces launched a large batch of drones during the past hours at several targets deep within the Zionist entity in occupied Palestine, and they reached their goals, thanks to God.
The Yemeni Armed Forces continue to carry out their military operations in support and victory for the oppression of the Palestinian people and in response to the calls and demands of the Yemeni people and all the peoples of the nation and until the Israeli aggression against our brothers in steadfast Gaza stops.
The victory comes only from God

2023-11-01T21:31:54+00:00,-1001458314607,"Seeing a lot of people confused by these news. ""These are Houthis, not the Yemeni government"" some people screech. You're wrong. Here's a quick crash course on some background history, the political landscape in Yemen & appropriate terminology:

1. The ""Houthis"" (known officially as the Ansarallah) is a broad grassroots movement with only a few defined political keypoints. This is deliberate, as the movement seeks to incorporate and represent the Yemeni people in its entirety across both Islamic and political differences. The movement has a right-wing, a centre-wing and a left-wing, each organized into separate unions and interest groups. For example, the left-wing is organized into what is called the ""Cultural Front Against the Aggression"", just to be very specific.

2. The ""Houthis"" ceased being a rebel group in late 2014 with the advent of the September 21st Revolution and the signing of the UN-sponsored Peace & National Partnership Agreement. 
Prior to 2014, the group could indeed be described as a rebel movement as it fought 6 consecutive wars against the corrupt Saudi-backed government of Ali Abdullah Saleh. In September 2014, when the ""Houthis"" entered Sana'a to topple said government, more than 2/3rds of the entire Yemeni Armed Forces switched and took their side instead of the side of the government, giving the ""Houthis"" access to missile stockpiles and heavy weapons. More on that further down.

3. There are currently two competing governments in Yemen, one based in the constitutional capital Sana'a, and one de-facto based in Aden - although the Aden-based government remains unable to exercise its authority there. The ""internationally-recognized government"" based in Aden doesn't actually operate from within Yemen, but from a shadow cabinet based in the luxurious Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh where they've been exiled since February 2015. 
Their direct authority is limited to warlord figures and tribal factions doing their bidding, representing less than 15% of Yemen's total population. In turn, the so-called ""Houthi rebels"" are part of what is called the Government of National Salvation, which exercises direct authority over 85% of Yemen's entire population.

4. The forces which have launched drones, ballistic & cruise missiles towards Israel are the forces aligned with the Government of National Salvation. They are far from being a ""rag-tag rebel group"", but operates as a truly conventional army. They don't ""represent"" the ""Houthis"", nor do they wage war on behalf of one party or group against another. They represent all of Yemen, and fight on behalf of all of Yemen without exception. They are the only Armed Force in Yemen loyal to a government with a parliamentary mandate to exercise authority - a mandate the Saudi-backed ""government"" does not have.

Tl;dr: It was indeed the Yemeni Armed Forces which launched the attacks against Israel.

On Oct 31, Hezbollah published the damage statistics of the Israeli army on the border areas of Lebanon in north of the occupied Palestine.

According to data provided by Hezbollah, the movement has managed to target 105 Israeli military sites and 140 cameras, 33 radars, 69 communication systems, 27 intelligence systems, 17 jamming systems and one drone. Also, 2 armored vehicles, 2 Humvees and 9 Merkava tanks were destroyed or damaged.

Also, 120 Israeli servicemen were killed or wounded. Hezbollah’s attacks have caused the evacuation of 28 settlements and the evacuation of 65,000 settlers from the area.

The analysis of these actions shows that the focus of the attacks is on the radar sites, communication and listening towers, tanks and armored vehicles of Israel in order to paralyze the Israeli espionage systems and also target the enemy’s strengths.

🔰 Israeli Military Forces Raid Juhor ad-Dik Area In The Eastern Gaza Strip

On October 30, Israeli armed forces, with the support of tanks and armored vehicles, entered the Juhar al-Dik area in the eastern Gaza Strip.

Israeli media outlets claimed that the tanks are advancing towards Salah al-Din Street (a road between Gaza, Breij and Khan Yunis) and have so far succeeded in destroying the positions of resistance fighters and reaching the Nitsarim area.

It should be noted that the Juhar al-Dik area is an uninhabited area with a few buildings and a little urban density. This area has a very weak military and security situation, which has prompted Palestinian resistance fighters not to create defensive positions there.

It is possible that the entry of Israeli military forces into the Juhar al-Dik area has been deliberately planned to estimate the potential blow by the Palestinian resistance fighters against the Israeli armed forces during any ground operation.

It should be noted that this area was also a site of conflict in the 2014 war and Israel experienced defeat there once. Therefore, if successful, Israel’s advancement could cut off the important Salah al-Din Street and also lead to urban conflict in Gaza city and the Al-Bureij camp.

Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said in parts of his speech about the war of the Zionist regime and the Palestinian resistance at the meeting of the United Nations General Assembly:

▪️The genocide of the Palestinian people in Gaza by the Zionist regime must be stopped immediately. The US and European countries see and support the killing of 7,000 civilians in Gaza by Israel.
▪️This is our home and West Asia is our region. We will not deal with any party or country that endangers the security of our region.
▪️We do not welcome the expansion of the war in the region, but if the war in Gaza continues, we cannot stop the fire. If this war continues, the US will not be spared from the fire.
▪️The Islamic Republic of Iran has proposed holding a referendum among all the residents of Palestine.
▪️Hamas is ready to release civilian prisoners and the world should support the release of 6,000 Palestinian prisoners too.

🔰 Israeli Regime Claims To Have Revealed Identity Of Al-Qassam Brigades’ Spokesperson! + Video

The Israeli regime’s army has released a video claiming to have obtained the true identity and face of Abu Obaida, the spokesperson for the Ezzedeen Al-Qassam Brigades, which is the military wing of the Hamas resistance movement in Palestine.

Avichay Adraee, the Arabic-speaking spokesman for the Israeli military, claimed on October 25 that the Israeli army has obtained a picture and the real identity of Abu Obaida. The spokesman for the Israeli army also claimed that Abu Obaida’s real name is Huzaifa Kahloot.

This is not the first time that the Israeli regime made such a claim. During the 2014 war, as part of a psychological warfare tactic against Palestinian resistance, Israel hacked into the Al-Aqsa network during one of Abu Obaida’s speeches and added subtitles with his real name and full identity. Israel claimed that the full name of the Al-Qassam spokesperson is Huzaifa Samir Abdullah al-Kahloot.

At that time, Hamas denied the information published by the Israeli army. However, after 9 years, the Israeli army spokesman revived this rumor and intends to initiate a new psychological and media warfare against the Ezzedeen Al-Qassam Brigades with this action.

It also appears that the republication of this claim is aimed at gathering news and confirming or denying Abu Obaida’s identity by the help of Palestinians, as well as assessing the type and extent of the resistance fighters’ reactions.

🔰 #Israel’s Ground Invasion Of Gaza Has Begun?!

This morning, a video was released by the Israeli regime, which showed that a number of tanks and armored vehicles of the Israeli regime entered the Gaza Strip. Reuters, citing the Israeli army, claimed that the forces of the Zionist army carried out a relatively large invasion of the Gaza Strip.

But the review of the published video does not show this claim. In this video, several armored vehicles such as Puma armored-engineering vehicles, Israeli caterpillar D9 armored-bulldozers and several Merkava tanks are seen crossing the fence or creating an embankment and building new routes around the fences, and the Merkava tanks are also providing fire support.

Therefore, considering that the Israelis will not start ground operations with this number of armored vehicles, two possibilities are envisioned for this move: the Israeli regime is preparing the environment for the start of military operations and building new routes and access points into the Gaza Strip. And at the same time, while achieving this goal, by conducting limited operations, it seeks to test the lines and identify the weak and strong points of the Palestinian resistance groups, as well as measure the type and intensity of the response by the Palestinian fighters. The Palestinian fighters also avoided all-out defense against this attack, being aware of this issue.

The Zionists also claimed that this missile is Iranian and is similar to the Russian Kha-55 cruise missile!

On the northern front, clashes and artillery attacks continue between Hezbollah and the Israeli army. As in the past days, Hezbollah attacked the border posts Israel in the Jal Alam area in the Labuna area (near Ras al-Naqourah), Manara, Al-Abad, Branit, and Al-Rahab using anti-tank guided missiles.

The Israeli army also attacked the areas of Yarun, Ayta al-Shaab, Ramie, Marwahin, Zahira, Ramish, Kafr Shuba and Halta, Harjiya and Al Ruwaisah with air and artillery attacks. Also Israeli drones targeted the heights of Jabal Sadaneh in the north of Kafr Shuba with four bombs.

According to Hezbollah’s announcement, nine members of Hezbollah were martyred in today’s clashes.

On the Golan front, the resistance forces in Syria attacked Israeli positions in the occupied Golan Heights with at least five rockets.

🔰 Latest Military Developments Of Gaza And Northern Palestine, 21 October 2023 (Map)

On the 15th day of fighting, there was no special and significant ground conflict around the Gaza Strip. The activity of the Israeli army’s ground forces around the Gaza Strip are currently still defensive. The only important change in this area is the Erez crossing. According to local sources, the Israeli regime has regained control of the Erez crossing in the north of the Gaza Strip. If the Israeli regime intends to attack the Gaza Strip by land, it is necessary to take control of all the northern areas of the Gaza Strip.

The resistance rocket attacks continue. On the 15th day, the resistance forces launched rocket attacks on Israeli settlements around the Gaza Strip and further areas; But the intensity of these attacks has decreased.

On the other hand, the heavy air attacks of the Israeli regime against different areas of the Gaza Strip continue. The situation of the people of the Gaza Strip is critical and the Israeli regime prevents the delivery of basic medical and food needs to the Gaza Strip. After international pressure and several days of gathering of people, human rights activists and journalists near the Rafah crossing, the Rafah crossing was opened for a short period of time for a limited number of trucks. However, this amount of aid only provides about 5% of the needs of the people of Gaza.

According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, Israel’s barbaric bombings against Gaza have resulted in the martyrdom of 4,385 people. Also, more than 13,500 people have been injured. In the West Bank, at least 81 Palestinians were martyred and more than 1,400 others were injured.

On the northern front, clashes and artillery duels continue between Hezbollah and the Israeli regime. As in the past days, Hezbollah attacked the border posts and military equipment of Israel several times using anti-tank guided missiles. But the important event of this day in the northern front was the entry of Israeli regime fighter jets into the battles. After fifteen days, for the first time, Israeli fighter jets bombed areas in southern Lebanon. The Israeli army fighter jets carried out five airstrikes in the areas of Ramieh, Ayta al-Shaab, Al Makb and Yaroun in southern Lebanon until the last hour of Saturday. This issue shows the increase of tensions in the north of Palestine and it seems that the conflicts have entered a new phase.

Also, during the battles of the 15th day, five Hezbollah forces were martyred.

According to Israeli media reports, 27,000 settlers have been evacuated from 28 settlements near the Lebanese border. The largest part of the evacuation operation of the border settlements is related to the town of Kiryat Shemona, which includes 23 thousand people.

The evacuation of border areas with Lebanon is an order approved by the Israeli regime’s war cabinet in on October 18. According to this order, the settlers must evacuate all border areas up to a distance of five kilometers from the Lebanese border and move to other settlements in occupied Palestine. This plan is to prevent civilian casualties in a possible war with Hezbollah and resistance groups in southern Lebanon.

🔰 Drone Attack On US Forces in Deir ez-Zor

On October 19, the US-led coalition base in Deir ez-Zor province was attacked by the resistance groups.

Initial reports indicated that in the last hours of October 19, the US occupation garrison in the al-Omar oil field in Deir Ezzor province was attacked by a suicide drone.

No group claimed responsibility for the attack.

It should be noted that earlier in the morning, the US bases at Conoco facility in Deir ez-Zor province and at al-Tanf area in southern Syria were also targeted by several rockets and drones.

Considering the tense situation in the region and people’s anger at Israel’s crimes, it seems that in the coming days we will see an increase in such attacks against the US interests and Israel in the region.

🔰 US Warship Downed Yemeni Missiles In The Red Sea

On October 19, a US Navy warship intercepted and destroyed several missiles and drones reportedly fired by the Yemeni Ansar Allah in the Red Sea.

According to reports, the USS Carney Arleigh Burke-class destroyer was attacked by several missiles from the coast of Yemen, but the warship managed to counter these attacks. However, contrary to this claim, a U.S. official stated that it did not appear that the warship was the target.

Israeli media also claimed that this attack was carried out with three missiles and a number of suicide drones, and it was probably aimed at attacking targets in the south of occupied Palestine. The American warship was in the northern half of the Red Sea when the attack occurred and managed to intercept the missiles.

“We cannot say for certain what these missiles and drones were targeting, but they were launched from Yemen heading north along the Red Sea, potentially towards targets in Israel,” Brigadier General Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon spokesman told reporters.

According to the data that ISWNEWS posses, the US and Israeli media’s claims about Ansar Allah’s attack on targets in the south of occupied Palestine are contradictory and far from reality. According to the claims, if the Yemeni armed forces want to use a cruise missile to attack the south of Israel, considering the longest-range cruise missile of Ansar Allah, which has a range of 1,650 kilometers, the cruise missile must directly pass through the sky of Saudi Arabia. Considering the current relations between Yemen and Saudi Arabia, this issue is almost impossible. If cruise missiles and suicide drones are used along the Read Sea, the aforementioned weapons do not have enough range to cross the Red Sea to the south of Palestine. Unless Ansar Allah shoots its drones from the water, but such a capability has not been seen from the boats of the Yemeni Navy so far. Therefore, the US and Israeli media’s claims about Ansar Allah’s attack on Israel is not true, and it is very likely that the target of the attack was the US military ships in the northern Red Sea, and it was carried out with a limited number of cruise missiles or suicide drones.

So, if this claim is true, Ansar Allah probably used Qods 3, Qods Z-0 cruise missiles or the new Sayad cruise missile.

🔰 The Second Attacks On Ain Al-Asad Airbase In Less Than 24 Hours!

The Islamic Resistance of Iraq attacked US positions in Ain al-Asad with several rockets.

Late on October 19, the US occupiers’ positions in Ain al-Asad airbase in Anbar province were targeted by Iraqi Islamic resistance rockets. This was the second attack on US military positions in Ain al-Asad base in the last 24 hours.

The Iraqi Islamic Resistance officially took responsibility for this attack by publishing a statement.

Earlier in the morning, on October 19, the US bases at Conoco facility in Deir ez-Zor province and at al-Tanf area in southern Syria were also targeted by several rockets and drones.

A day before, Reuters news agency, citing the US officials, stated that the Ain al-Asad Airbase in Anbar province of Iraq was targeted by a drone attack on October 18.

Iraqi resistance groups have announced the formation of a joint operations room named Tufan Al-Aqsa (Al-Aqsa Storm) in Iraq in support of Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation forces. Considering the tense situation in the region and people’s anger at Israel’s crimes, it seems that in the coming days we will see an increase in these attacks against America and even Israel at the regional level.

🔰 Latest Military Developments Of Gaza And The Occupied Territories, 19 October 2023 (Map)

On the 13th day of the fighting, there was no special and significant ground conflict around the Gaza Strip. The movements of the Israeli army’s ground forces around the Gaza Strip are currently still defensive. Also, rocket attacks on Israeli settlements around the Gaza Strip and further areas continue.

On the northern front, missile and artillery clashes continue between Hezbollah and the Israeli regime. On this day, Hezbollah attacked a large number of security and communication equipment of the Israeli army in areas such as Ras al-Naqura, Rahab, Jal al-Alam and Hanita, using light artillery fire and anti-armor guided missiles. Also, three ATGM missiles were fired towards the Israeli outpost in Zar’it. The interesting point of today’s attacks was the simultaneous and coordination of Hezbollah’s attacks with the rocket attacks of al-Qassam and al-Quds Brigades, which were carried out in several stages. At the same time as Hezbollah’s attacks, the Palestinian forces fired more than 36 rockets towards the north of occupied Palestine.

Another important event today was the escalation of tensions and armed conflicts in the West Bank. The Zionist army and security forces carried out a massive raid on the Nur Shams camp in the Tulkarm area. The raid was launched from the early hours of morning with the aim of hitting Saraya al-Quds forces in the camp. In these clashes, an Israeli military vehicle was targeted by a roadside bomb. The intensity of clashes was so high that the Israeli regime in an unprecedented move, targeted positions of the resistance forces in this camp by using a suicide drone. 12 Palestinians were martyred and an unknown number of Israeli forces were also killed and wounded. Israel only admitted the death of one of its border guard officers, Maxim Rezinkov, in these battles.

Regarding the casualties of the sides in the battles of the last two weeks, the Ministry of Health of Palestine announced the number of martyrs in the Gaza Strip to be more than 3,500 and the number of wounded to be more than 12,000. Also, 69 people have been martyred in the West Bank and more than 1,300 people have been injured. On the Israeli side, the casualty figures have not changed significantly, and Israel refuses to provide accurate statistics.

🔰 Heavy Clashes Between Israeli Forces, Al-Quds Brigades In West Bank

Palestinian resistance fighters clashed with Israeli regime’s security forces in the Nur Shams Camp in the city of Tulkarm, northwest of the West Bank on October 19.

ISWNews Analysis Group – The armed clashes occurred after the Israeli army and security forces launched a widespread raid on the Nur Shams Camp early this morning. During the clashes, 10 Palestinians were martyred and an unspecified number of Israeli forces were killed and injured.

Al-Quds Brigades, the military wing of the Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine, announced in a statement that its fighters in the Nur Shams Camp successfully carried out several bombing operations against Israeli military and security vehicles, but did not mention the possible casualties and damages of this attack.

In response to the destruction of its military vehicle in the Nur Shams Camp, the Israeli army targeted the Al-Manshiyya neighborhood in this camp with a suicide drone.

This attack caused some injuries to some residents and Palestinian fighters. The Israeli regime’s forces have blocked the camp’s routes and prevented ambulances from entering the area after this attack.

Currently, the conflict in the Nur Shams Camp is still ongoing, and Israeli forces have besieged Palestinian militants in a mosque in the camp.

🔰 Resistance Forces Attacks Two US Bases In Syria

On Oct. 19, the US bases at Conoco facility in Deir Ezzor province and at al-Tanf area in southern Syria were targeted by several rockets and drones.

On Thursday morning, the positions of the US coalition in the Conoco gas facility in northern Syria was targeted by rocket attacks by the resistance groups.

Hours after this attack, the US occupation garrison in al-Tanf was also targeted by drone attacks. It is said that the explosion was heard from inside this base.

So far, no group has officially claimed responsibility for these attacks, but according to the recent warnings of the Resistance and the current situation in the region, these attacks were carried out by the Resistance Axis.

It seems that these attacks are aimed at increasing the cost and a serious warning to America to cast doubt on the position of the White House to enter the Gaza war.

Checking of videos and images published by local sources and social media platforms prove that at the same time when the Palestinian resistance groups were conducting rocket attacks on occupied territories of Palestine on Tuesday night, Israeli fighter jets carried out air strikes on targets in the Gaza Strip.

The Israelis’ attacks also include Al-Ahli Arab (Al-Mamadani) Hospital, but the Israeli authorities have spent the past 24 hours attempting to clear their tracks in this crime by using media tools and casting doubt on their role in this heinous war crime!

🔰 Israel’s Readiness For Potential Drone, Missile Strikes By Resistance Fighters

On October 18, the war cabinet of the Israeli regime has issued orders to evacuate residents of border villages in northern occupied Palestine and to ban drone and paraglider flights in the skies of occupied Palestinian territories in order to prepare for possible attacks by resistance forces.

According to Israeli media outlets, the war cabinet of the regime agreed on Wednesday to evacuate the Kiryat Shmona settlement as well as border villages and towns up to five kilometers from the Lebanese borderline.

The Israeli Ministry of Transport also announced a ban on all drone and paraglider flights in the skies over occupied Palestine.

In case that such decisions are implemented, the likelihood of military operations and extensive clashes between the Israeli army and Hezbollah in southern Lebanon will increase more than ever.

The Israeli regime also banned the flight of lightweight aircraft and other objects to prevent disruptive actions, which can hinder concentration of its defense forces to detect and counter resistance drone attacks in a timely manner.

🔰 Palestinian Resistance Fighters Confront Israeli Forces in Beersheba

Hebrew-language media outlets have reported clashes between resistance fighters and Israeli military in the area of Hatzerim near the city of Bir Seb’a (Beersheba) on October 18.

According to local sources, there is intense fighting between resistance fighters and Israeli security forces near the Hatzerim Airbase, and Israeli settlers have been asked not to leave their homes.

It is worth noting that the Hatzerim Airbase is located a considerable distance from the Gaza border and even in the early days of the Operation Al-Aqsa Storm and despite the advances of Palestinian resistance fighters in occupied territories, there were no reports of ground clashes in the Bir Seb’a region.

The new clash shows that Israeli military forces are still facing serious difficulties in fully clearing occupied territories and areas infiltrated by the Palestinian fighters; so, it is possible that in the coming days we would also witness clashes between resistance fighters and Israeli forces in Israeli settlements around the Gaza Strip.

🔰 Establishment Of Joint Operations Room In Iraq; Drone Attack On US Terrorists In Erbil!

Iraqi resistance groups have announced the formation of a joint operations room named Tufan Al-Aqsa (Al-Aqsa Storm) in the Arab country. Simultaneously with this announcement, the positions of the United States’ forces at Al-Harir Air Base were targeted in a drone attack by the resistance group named Tashkil al-Waritheen (the Inheritors).

On October 18, Iraqi resistance groups announced the formation of a joint operations room named Tufan al-Aqsa (Al-Aqsa Storm) in Iraq to carry out their religious duty and support the Operation Al-Aqsa Storm in the Gaza Strip.

After the announcement was released, the Tashkil al-Waritheen resistance group declared that at 12 pm on Wednesday, the US military headquarters at Al-Harir Air Base in northeastern Erbil, were targeted by a drone attack by their group.

In addition to the attack, the Tashkil al-Warithin resistance group has a record of drone attacks on American terrorists’ positions in Kuwait as well as in Homs Governorate in Syria.

It is worth mentioning that the drone attack on Harir base was the second attack on the US bases in Iraq during the past 24 hours. A few hours ago, the Ain al-Asad base in Al-Anbar province, was targeted by a drone attack.

🔰 Drone Attack On US Army In Ain Al-Asad Airbase

Reuters news agency, citing the US officials, claimed that the Ain al-Asad Airbase in Anbar province of Iraq was targeted by a drone attack on October 18.

According to this report, two US officials in a conversation with Reuters stated that the US military foiled a drone attack against US forces at the Ain al-Asad airbase. The attacking drones reportedly were intercepted and destroyed before hitting the targets.

Hours after this attack, the Iraqi resistance took responsibility for the attack.

This attack took place hours after last night’s Israeli attack on al-Ma’amadani (al-Ahli) hospital in Gaza, which resulted in the death of at least 500 civilians. After this incident, widespread protests were sparked worldwide against Israel’s crimes against the Gaza Strip, and people of different countries took to the streets and expressed their protest and anger towards the Zionist regime of Israel and its supporter, the United States.

The attack of Iraqi resistance groups on the Ain al-Asad Air Base was also an attempt to retaliate for Israel’s crime last night.

Considering the tense situation in the region and people’s anger at Israel’s crimes, it seems that in the coming days we will see an increase in these attacks against America and even Israel at the regional level.

🔰 Latest Military Developments Of Gaza And Northern Palestine, 17 October 2023 (Map)

On the 11th day of the fighting, there was no special and significant ground conflict around the Gaza Strip. The movements of the Israeli army’s ground forces around the Gaza Strip are currently still defensive.

Rocket attacks on Israeli settlements around the Gaza Strip and further areas continue.

On the northern front, missile and artillery clashes continue between Hezbollah and the Israeli regime. Today, Hezbollah fired several ATGM missiles at Israeli positions, tanks and defense equipment in response to the Israeli army’s attacks on the border areas. According to Hezbollah, in these clashes, a Merkava tank in the village of Shtula, an Israeli military outpost in the Ramim area, an Israeli army vehicle in the Metula area, Israeli army positions in the Kiryat Shemuna area, and a gathering of Israeli soldiers at the border village of the Ramya and Beyaz Belida were attacked and hit by ATGM missiles. Hezbollah claims that as a result of the attacks two Israeli servicemen were definitely killed and another was injured.

The Israeli regime also attacked several areas in southern Lebanon, such as Aitron, Al-Bustana, Misra, Ramiah, Marwahin and Zahira with artillery and incendiary phosphorus bombs. As a result of these attacks, five Hezbollah members were martyred. Also, the International Committee of the Red Cross in Lebanon announced that four Palestinian civilians were martyred as a result of the Israeli army’s artillery attacks on the town of Alama al-Shaab in the south of Lebanon.

In the political sphere, this morning General Michael Eric Korilla, the commander the US Army’s Central Command (CENTCOM) arrived in Tel Aviv at the head of a military delegation. During this trip, he met with Herzi Halevi, Chief of the General Staff of the Israeli Army, and other Israeli defense and military officials. It is said that soon Joe Biden will also travel to Israel.

Another very bitter and important incident that happened in the last hours of this day is the targeting of al-Ma’madani hospital in the Gaza Strip, which led to the martyrdom of more than 500 Palestinians, including a large number of children. This huge crime caused a wide wave of popular protests worldwide and these protests are still ongoing.

🔰 Latest Military Developments Of Gaza And Northern Palestine, 16 October 2023 (Map)

On the 10th day of the fighting, there was no special and significant ground conflict around the Gaza Strip. The activity of the Israeli army’s ground forces around the Gaza Strip are currently still defensive.

Most of today’s incidents in Gaza and its surroundings are related to the bombing of different areas of the Gaza Strip by the Israeli regime, as well as the rocket attacks on the settlements in the occupied territories by the Palestinian resistance groups.

On this day, Palestinian resistance fighters targeted the occupied areas around the Gaza Strip as well as distant areas such as Tel Aviv and Haifa with hundreds of rockets. It is worth mentioning that as a result of the rocket attacks on Tel Aviv and the observation and interception of several rockets near the Israeli Knesset building, the session of the Israeli representatives was closed.

On the other hand, the brutal bombing of different areas of Gaza by the Israeli regime continues. According to the latest statistics provided by the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip, the number of martyrs in Gaza has reached 2,778 and the number of injured has reached more than 10,000.

The Israeli army also published the names of eight other soldiers of this regime who were killed in recent battles. Thus, according to the information published by the Israeli army, the number of “military” deaths of this regime since the beginning of the war in Gaza has reached 299 people.

In the northern front, tensions and artillery clashes and air attacks continue in all border lines of Lebanon. On the 10th day of fighting, the Israeli army targeted Hezbollah positions in the north of the Lebanese border on several occasions. Hezbollah forces also targeted the positions of Israeli forces in the north of occupied Palestine on several occasions. Also, a Merkava tank of the Israeli regime was hit by an anti-tank missile in Al-al-Dahira area.

In the political sphere, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Israel for the second time in the last few days and met with Netanyahu and officials of this regime. It should be noted that Antony Blinken traveled to Jordan, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia a few days ago, after the first round of meetings with Zionist officials, and consulted with high-ranking officials of the aforementioned countries regarding the latest developments in the region.

Among the other important points of this day, we can mention the Wall Street Journal’s report on the greater role of the US in the Gaza war. The Wall Street Journal stated that US Defense Department officials have prepared 2,000 troops to support any Israeli ground operations in the Gaza Strip.

It seems that the US is preparing the region and coordinating with the heads of some countries to help the Israeli regime to start ground operations and a massive invasion of Gaza.

🔰 Latest Military Developments Of Gaza And Northern Palestine, 15 October 2023 (Map)

On the ninth day of the fighting, Palestinian fighters attacked positions of the Israeli army in the Nir Am area near Sderot. This news was confirmed by the Hebrew media. The Israeli media reported the occurrence of an armed conflict between the Palestinian resistance forces and the Israeli military in Nir Am.

This type of offensive attacks by the resistance fighters against the Zionists, which has been repeated several times in recent days in different axes and conflict zones, is aimed at disrupting the Israeli concentration and opening a new line or front.

It is likely that with the increase of speculations about the imminent start of Israeli ground offensive in the Gaza Strip, the attacks of Palestinian resistance groups in the occupied territories will also increase.

On the 9th day, like the previous day, there was no special and significant conflict in other lines of the Gaza Strip. The movements of the Israeli army’s ground forces around the Gaza Strip are currently still defensive.

On this day, rocket attacks by Palestinian forces against Israeli areas and towns continued. But compared to the previous days, the intensity of rocket attacks has decreased. In one of these attacks, the resistance forces targeted the city of Haifa with more than 30 rockets.

According to some reports, the US has asked the Israeli regime to delay the start of ground operations in Gaza for a few days. It should also be noted that tonight’s meeting of the Israeli regime’s cabinet, which was supposed to be held at 20:30 local time, was canceled.

On the other hand, the heavy bombing of various areas of Gaza and the destruction of buildings and infrastructure facilities in the Gaza Strip continue. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in the Gaza Strip, the number of martyrs in Gaza has increased to 2,670 and the number of wounded has reached more than 9,600.

On the ninth day of the battles, unlike the southern front, the conflicts on the northern front have increased significantly. Since this morning, the border areas of Lebanon and occupied Palestine have witnessed intense artillery clashes and missile and air attacks, and each side has targeted each other’s positions on several occasions.

At noon today, Palestinian groups fired several rockets from the south of Lebanon towards the Israeli occupation in Nahariya and other settlements in the West Galilee region in the north of occupied Palestine.

During the battles of this day, the Lebanese Hezbollah targeted two Merkava tanks and an Israeli personnel carrier in the Hanita region using an anti-tank guided missiles. According to Hezbollah’s announcement, several Zionist soldiers were killed and wounded in this attack. Also, in another battle, Hezbollah forces targeted the Israeli border base called Raheb with ATGM missiles and artillery near the town of Ayta ash Shab in southern Lebanon. Also, images were published by the resistance-oriented media claiming that the Hezbollah flag was raised in this base.

One of the highlights in the northern front is the increase of casualties of Israeli forces. With the increase of tensions in this region, the number of Israeli dead and wounded is also increasing. Yoav Zeitoun, an Israeli journalist, recently said in this regard: “The fifth Israeli soldier was killed by Hezbollah in less than a week on the northern borders; This issue may lead to war, but the army is responding in a balanced way so as not to escalate the situation on the northern border.”

According to the comments of Israeli reporters and media, as well as the way the Israeli regime operates in this front, it seems that the Israeli regime is afraid of the activation of a new broad and comprehensive war front in northern Palestine And tries to avoid increasing tensions as much as possible by giving limited and measured answers.

On October 15, Palestinian resistance groups attacked Israeli army positions in northern Haifa with at least 30 rockets. Following the rocket attack, the sirens were sounded in the occupied neighborhoods of Nahariya and other neighborhoods in the western Galilee region, located in the north of Haifa.

The Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Palestinian resistance movement Hamas claimed responsibility for the rocket attack.

Hezbollah issued a statement on the attack, announcing that in response to recent strikes carried out by Israeli military forces against Aalma El Chaeb and Sheba’a villages in Lebanon, the Lebanese resistance group targeted two Merkava tanks and an armored vehicle in the Hanita kibbutz with guided missiles, killing and injuring several Israeli soldiers.

In response to the casualties suffered as a result of Hezbollah’s attacks, the Israeli army used white phosphorus bombs during armed clashes in the southern Lebanese village of Ayta ash-Shab.

It is worth mentioning that the international organizations and the Western states have not taken any stance in the face of the Israeli regime’s usage of prohibited weapons against the Palestinian and Lebanese people so far.

🔰 Iranian Foreign Minister: The Resistance In The Region Are “Fully Ready” To Respond To Any Move By Israel

Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian, speaks during a joint press conference with his Lebanese counterpart Abdallah Bouhabib, in Beirut at the end of a tour that took him to Syria, Iraq and Lebanon.

Amir-Abdollahian said that the Resistance Front will give a decisive response at a proper time if the international community delays stopping the Zionists from committing war crimes.

I found out in conversation with the leaders of Resistance that the resistance response will be decisive and regret-inducing, and will change the current map of the occupied territories (Palestine)."" he said.

Amir-Abdollahian added: ""A political decision can be made before the situation gets out of control, but it may be too late. If war crimes stop and the parties agree on a ceasefire, then it will be the forces of “resistance” (Palestinian) that will determine its terms.""

""We are in constant consultation with allies in the region, but do not interfere in their plans and actions. The resistance has the ability to defend itself, and we will take all necessary diplomatic measures to stop the aggression and lift the blockade of Gaza.""

In response to a question about Iran filing a complaint against crimes against humanity by the Zionist regime, the foreign minister said: ""We have proposed holding an extraordinary meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and we are ready to hold this meeting in Tehran. The Secretary General of this organization is going to choose a special representative to follow up on issues related to the Palestinian area, and the documents of the war crimes of this regime will be collected for presentation in the national and international courts of the countries. In the history of the past seven decades, many legal complaints have been filed by the legal centers associated with Palestine, but they have not been resolved due to unfair treatment.""

🔰 Latest Military Developments Of Gaza, 13 October 2023 (Map)

On the seventh day of the fighting, Palestinian fighters attacked the Zikim area in the north of the Gaza Strip and clashed with the Israeli regime forces. The fighting continues sporadically in this area. Also, the resistance forces penetrated around Be’eri settlement and clashed with the Israeli regime forces. No special and significant conflict was observed in other front lines of the Gaza Strip.

Another important event that made headlines on this day was the Zionist regime’s ultimatum to the residents of the northern areas of the Gaza Strip. On Friday, the Israeli regime set a 24-hour deadline for the evacuation of Gaza City and the northern areas of the Gaza Strip. The Israeli regime warns that all civilians must evacuate the northern areas of the Gaza Strip until the Wadi Gaza.

The northern areas of Gaza have a population of about 1,100,000 people and it is an extremely dense area. After announcing this warning, a large number of people are evacuating the northern areas of Gaza. It should be noted that in recent days, a large number of civilians have been killed due to the barbaric bombings of the Zionist regime. The severity of Israeli bombings and crimes is so great that, according to Hebrew sources, the Minister of War of the Zionist regime has asked Netanyahu to reduce the amount of bombings because the massive attacks on the Gaza Strip will lead to the loss of support from some certain countries.

In the political sphere, in order to continue its attacks and prepare the conditions for a ground operation on the Gaza Strip, Israel needs the support of a part of the world’s public opinion as well as the support of the heads of some governments. Therefore, the warning and evacuation deadline for the northern residents of the Gaza Strip is interpreted in this direction. If all the civilians are evacuated, or at least a large part of the civilians are evacuated, the necessary justification will be provided to increase the heavier bombings on Gaza.

In the military sphere, it seems that Israel intends to completely destroy the northern areas of Gaza. In fact, according to the readiness of the resistance forces to respond to any ground aggression of the Israeli regime in this area, the Israeli regime first tries to destroy all important infrastructures, routes and roads, tunnels, possible places of deployment of the Palestinian forces, etc. and then after severe weakening the forces and positions of the Palestinian fighters, launch a ground attack on this area.

🔰 Summary Of Rocket Attacks On The Occupied Territories, 13 October 2023

Since this morning, the Palestinian resistance groups have attacked the occupied territories and the positions of the Israeli regime in Tel Aviv, Sderot, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Beersheba, Safed and near the Gaza Strip with hundreds of rockets.

Al-Qassam Brigades used Ayyash 250 rockets in the attack on Safed town in northern Palestine. The Israeli media claim that the David’s Sling air defense system, which was activated for the first time since the beginning of the Al-Aqsa storm operation, succeeded in destroying this rocket in the sky of Safed. However, the Palestinian media reported that the rocket hit, citing pictures of smoke rising from an unknown location in Safed.

Also, according to Israeli media reports, the town of Ashkelon has been the record holder for the number of rockets hit and fallen since the beginning of the fighting, with at least a thousand rockets fired from the Gaza Strip.

🔰 Lapid’s Opposition To The Formation Of Netanyahu’s Emergency Cabinet!

According to Channel 12 of the Israeli regime, Yair Lapid, the leader of the opposition, said in response to the formation of the emergency government: We will not join the emergency government. This is the mistake in the thinking of Gantz and Eizenkot. Lapid also accused Netanyahu’s government of committing an unforgivable mistake due to the attack by Hamas.

Lapid’s statement shows that, contrary to the declaration of some Hebrew-language media as well as the propaganda of pro-Netanyahu media, there is no broad political unity behind the emergency government with the participation of some opposition parties.

It was previously announced that Yair Lapid’s party responded to Netanyahu’s proposal and announced that it will not join Netanyahu’s cabinet as long as the radical parties of Otzma Yehudit, led by Itamar Ben-Gvir, and the Religious Zionist Party, led by Bezalel Smotrich, are present in Netanyahu’s cabinet.

🔰 Palestinians’ Defensive Plans More Powerful Than Their Offensive Program: Hamas

In an interview with Al Jazeera, Saleh al-Arouri, Deputy Head of the Political Bureau of Hamas, made important remarks about the recent operations of the Palestinian resistance.

Some important parts of statements made by Deputy Head of the Political Bureau of Hamas Saleh al-Arouri in an interview with Al Jazeera are as follows:

We received some information that the Israelis were preparing to attack us (the Gaza Strip) after the Jewish holidays. We launched a preemptive strike on Israeli military forces near Gaza, and the enemy forces quickly collapsed.

The attack by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades was a well-organized and coordinated operation that targeted the Israeli regime’s Gaza battalion. Some 1,200 Qassam fighters entered the Israeli settlements around the Gaza Strip and quickly took control of the positions of the regime’s Gaza battalion. When the unit collapsed, non-combatant Palestinians also entered the occupied territories from the Gaza Strip and clashed with Israeli settlers, resulting in some casualties. The Palestinians were also able to enter some Zionist settlements and take civilians hostage, but this move has never been part of our operational plan nor is it part of our ideology.

The instructions of the al-Qassam Brigades’ commanders to their forces in respect of the prohibition of killing women and children were transparent.

We have had plans and programs in response to any action by the Israeli enemy. Our defensive plans were prepared before the start of the attack, and our defensive plans are much stronger than our offensive plans, and the Israeli enemy is well aware of the fact.

We fight so that the world recognizes the right to life of our people like other nations. We count on the people of our country and wait for them to get involved in the fight and support us.

🔰 Israeli Air Strikes On Airports In Syria’s Damascus, Aleppo

Fighter jets of the Israeli regime’s army fired several missiles at airports in Aleppo and Damascus, Syria and put the airports out of the service.

On October 12, Israeli army’s fighter jets targeted airports in the Syrian governorates of Aleppo and Damascus.

According to preliminary information, the two airports are said to have been taken out of service, because the air strikes caused damages to the airport runways in Damascus and Aleppo governorates.

Following an Israeli airstrike on Damascus airport, a Mahan Air Airbus A340-313 aircraft bound for Damascus changed course and returned from Syrian skies towards Iran’s air space.

No further details have been released so far, but following the circulation of news stories about the Israeli air strike on Syria, some Hebrew-language media outlets immediately reported that the air strikes were aimed at disrupting and halting the process of any assistance and support from Iran to its allies in the region.

🔰 Latest Military Developments Around Gaza Strip, 9 October 2023 (Map)

The armed clashes between Palestinian resistance fighters and Israeli military continued for the third consecutive day. Despite the claims of the Israeli army to cleanse and reoccupy all the surrounding neighborhoods of the Gaza Strip, the map of the battlefield has not changed significantly.

The Israeli regime’s army announced on the third day of the clashes that it has taken control of all the surrounding neighborhoods of the Gaza Strip. However, the field realities tell a different story, and the battles are still ongoing.

The only change in the battle lines is related to the Zikim region and the Zikim military base in the north of the Gaza Strip and the Karam Abu Salem crossing and its surrounding areas in the south of the Gaza Strip. The Israeli authorities claim to have regained control of the Zikim military base.

The clashes also continue along all the conflict lines and especially in the areas of Mafalsim, Kfar Aza, Nahal Oz, the outskirts of Be’eri, Kissufim, and Magen. The clashes continue in the important town of Sderot.

Spokesman for the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades Abu Obaida announced that the Al-Qassam Brigades successfully carried out another infiltration operation on the third day of the battle with the aim of displacing Israeli forces in the engaged positions. He added that today we targeted Sderot with several rockets to help our resistance fighters in this town.

According to reports, Palestinian resistance fighters once again succeeded in infiltrating into the Mishmar HaNegev settlement 20 kilometers deep into the occupied territories. Also, Palestinian commando forces managed to infiltrate into the city of Ashkelon once more. However, no information is available about the fate of these mentioned clashes.

The Israeli regime’s army continues to dispatch troops and equipment to southern areas. According to unconfirmed information, the Israeli army has deployed about 100,000 troops to the southern region. Western sources, quoting US officials, also reported that the Israeli regime’s army is likely to launch a large-scale ground operation against Gaza within the next 48 hours.

Simultaneously with these movements, the savage and relentless bombardment of Gaza continues. According to the Palestinian Ministry of Health, since the beginning of the Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, some 687 Palestinians have been martyred and 3,900 others have been injured.

Some Israeli sources also reported that the number of Israeli casualties in resistance attacks from the beginning of the Operation Al-Aqsa Storm until now has reached 1,100 dead and 2,741 injured.

🔰 Increase In Airstrikes, Artillery Attacks In Syria Under Shadow Of War In Palestine; Syrian Army Artillery, Russian Fighter Jets Take Breath Of Armed Militants!

While the attention of all regional and international media outlets is focused on the battle between the Israeli regime and Palestinian resistance groups, tensions in Syria, especially in the northern regions of the Arab country, have significantly escalated in the past three days.

Turkish military helicopters have targeted at least 146 positions in northern Syria in the past 72 hours. Russian fighter jets and Syrian army artillery continuously bombarded positions belonging to armed groups and terrorists in the Idlib Governorate.

Turkiye’s relentless airstrikes on northern Syria are carried out following a terrorist attack on the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Ankara and under the pretext of combating the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK) terrorism.

The Syrian army’s attacks on Idlib Governorate are also carried out following a terrorist attack by a drone on a military academy in Homs Governorate, which resulted in the martyrdom of 89 people.

According to local sources, the airstrikes by Turkish military helicopters have targeted 24 infrastructure facilities, 87 residential buildings, 14 Syrian army bases, 10 bases belonging to the so-called Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), 6 farms, 3 factories, one school, and one hospital.

On the other hand, tensions between the Syrian army and armed groups in northern and northwestern Syria have increased due to the drone attack on the military academy in Homs Governorate and, as a result, an increase in artillery and airstrikes by the Syrian army on the positions of armed groups is visible.

On October 7-8, the positions of armed groups in areas such as Al-Nayrab, Al-Fatirah, Al-Ruwaiha, Ariha, Darat Izza, Idlib, and Jisr al-Shughur were targeted by the Syrian army’s artillery. Russian fighter jets also targeted the positions of armed groups in Ma’arrat Misrin and Kobani.

In response to these attacks, the armed groups targeted the areas of Nubl, Al-Zahraa, and Qardaha with artillery attacks. Local sources also claimed that a suicide drone near the military academy in Aleppo was tracked and destroyed by the Syrian army’s air defense systems. Further details and casualty figures of these attacks have not been released so far.

🔰 What Does Official Declaration Of Israeli War On Palestine Mean?

The office of Prime Minister of the Israeli regime Benjamin Netanyahu has announced that Israel’s security cabinet has officially approved the start of a war against the Gaza Strip.

This declaration means activating Article 40 of Israel’s constitution. In this situation, the Israeli army has complete freedom to carry out extensive military activities and use all its air, land, and sea forces anywhere and can act independently. The last time that the Israeli regime used this clause was in the war against Arab states (Syria and Egypt) in 1973.

Given Netanyahu’s harsh statements and the goals of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, according to commander of the Izz ad-Din Qassam Brigades in Palestine Mohammed al-Deif, it is unlikely that the war would come to an end soon. 

Therefore, the process of starting and forming Israel’s main response to resistance operations may take several days. The reason for this is that Israel was caught off guard and was not prepared for such engagement. Therefore, Israeli air and ground force commanders are designing their operations against the Gaza Strip.

This operation will undoubtedly be accompanied by the widespread presence of invasive aircraft such as fighter jets, drones, helicopters, as well as armored equipment such as tanks and armored vehicles.

Under these circumstances, it remains to be seen what measures the resistance fighters have taken to counter Israel’s potential operations.

Is another surprise like Hezbollah’s engagement and Syrian resistance forces into the war in Palestine on the way? Will the next surprise occur in the West Bank? Or will the battle in the Gaza Strip ultimately be limited by Arab countries’ mediation to a ceasefire?

As the dimensions of the ongoing war become more obvious, we will delve deeper into the issue in the coming days.

On the second day of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, Palestinian resistance fighters retreated from some liberated areas after fulfilling their objectives and facing increased pressures as well as tightening of siege by Israeli military personnel; however, intense clashes are now taking place between both sides in Israeli settlements and areas surrounding the Gaza Strip.

Following the advancement of the Israeli army, Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades and Al-Quds Brigades sent some auxiliary forces to support their own fighters in Israeli settlements. Additionally, the rocket and artillery units of the resistance movement launched several attacks against Israeli positions and forces to support and cover their own forces.

On the other hand, in response to these attacks, Israeli military drones targeted military and non-military areas as well as border areas with occupied Palestinian territories in multiple assaults, resulting in several martyrs and injuries.

According to updated reports, the attacks by the Al-Qassam Brigades, the military wing of the Hamas movement, on Ashkelon have been halted, and the resistance fighters have now retreated from several battle fronts in Kissufim, Nahal Oz, and Zikim.

🔰 Latest Military Developments Around Gaza Strip, 7 October 2023 (Map)

The examination of the latest developments in battle fields around the Gaza Strip and the advances of the resistance forces on October 7, 2023

After the start of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm and the unexpected advances made by the resistance fighters deep into the occupied Palestinian territories, many areas around the Gaza Strip came under the control of the resistance fighters.

However, due to the counter-attacks by the Israeli regime’s army and following the de-escalation of clashes, the resistance fighters tactically retreated from some positions. Therefore, it is now possible to draw map of the battlefields and ongoing engagements with greater accuracy.

According to the latest available information, following the deadly attacks by the resistance fighters on the Re’im base and inflicting heavy damages on the Israeli regime’s army, the resistance fighters retreated from Re’im area and its military base.

Similarly, in the Netivot axis, the resistance fighters tactically retreated towards Kfar Aza and Nahal Oz following the Israeli army’s counter-attack.

However, despite some retreats, an unknown number of resistance fighters are still present in the areas of Ofakim, Mishmar HaNegev, and even in Ashkelon.
Armed conflicts between the resistance fighters and the Israeli regime’s army continue in other battlefronts, including the city of Sderot, the surrounding areas of Zikim, Kfar Aza, Nahal Oz, Be’eri, and Magen.

🔰 Resistance Axis Declares Support For Palestinian Groups’ Operations Against Israel

The Islamic Republic of Iran, other Muslim nations, and resistance groups in the region have declared support for Palestinian resistance groups, considering the Palestinians’ operations against the Zionist regime as a new chapter in the resistance against occupiers.

Nasser Kanaani, Spokesperson for the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stated that this operation has created a new chapter in the field of resistance and armed operations against the Israeli occupiers in occupied territories of Palestine and demonstrated that the resistance movement in Palestine has good confidence in carrying out hybrid and multifaceted operations against the occupiers.

Resistance groups, including Hezbollah from Lebanon, Kata’ib Hezbollah from Iraq, as well as other resistance movements, have expressed their support for Palestinian resistance operations against Israel.

The Political Office of Ansar Allah movement as well as spokesman for Ansar Allah and head of negotiations for the Yemeni Salvation Government Mohammed Abdul-Salam congratulated Palestinian resistance forces on the ongoing military operations under the name Operation Al-Quds Storm. The Ansar Allah movement and the Yemeni Salvation Government reaffirmed their support for Palestine and readiness to participate in the battle against the Zionist regime, and called on the residents and freedom fighters in Arab and Islamic countries to support the people and resistance of Palestine against Israel.

It should be noted that the Committee tasked with organizing activities in Yemen has asked various segments of the Yemeni people to gather and protest in Sanaa city on Saturday concurrent with the first day of the Operation Al-Quds Storm in support of the Palestinian people and resistance groups.

However, foreign ministries of Arab countries, including Saudi Arabia, have called for restraint from both sides and support for civilians as well as an immediate cessation of hostilities. Among Arab countries, the Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs had a more diverse response, stating that Israel bears full responsibility for the ongoing clashes in occupied territories and citing repeated violations of the rights of the Palestinian people, with the recent incident being the extensive attacks by Zionists on Al-Aqsa Mosque as the cause of the operation.

The United States, while fully siding with the Israeli regime, has declared by its Department of Defense that it will make efforts to ensure that Israel obtains what it needs for self-defense.

According to Israeli media outlets, this is the first time since the 1948 war that extensive clashes have taken place within Zionist territories, and this unprecedented event will undoubtedly reveal its consequences in the coming days.

🔰 Palestinian Resistance Inflicting Heavy Intelligence Blow on Israel!

The start of surprising and hybrid attacks by the Palestinian resistance fighters and the military reaction of the Zionists in the face of the fresh strikes shows that the intelligence and security institutions of the Zionist regime did not issue the smallest warning before the onset of these attacks and have failed to identify the movements of the Palestinian resistance!

On the morning of October 7, Palestinian resistance fighters, in response to recent Zionist aggressions against the Palestinian people and the desecration of Al-Aqsa Mosque, launched an operation called “Operation Al-Aqsa Storm” against the Israelis.

During the military operation, Palestinian resistance fighters quickly crossed the military barriers of the Zionist regime and entered the settlements around Gaza Strip as well as Israeli military bases, resulting in the death of several Israeli soldiers and the capture of others by the fighters of Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades.

While Palestinian resistance commanders had been planning and preparing their forces for some time to respond to the Zionist regime’s brutal actions and atrocities against the Palestinian people, Israeli intelligence agencies were unaware of these plans and movements of the Palestinian resistance.

Despite claims by Israeli media and commanders about 24-hour surveillance of resistance commanders and 100% supervision over Palestinian groups, Israeli military institutions failed to confront these attacks.

The military reaction of the Zionists, the number of Israelis killed, the speed of advancement of resistance forces, and their movements in settlements and Israeli military bases show that Israeli soldiers were completely caught off guard.

One of the main reasons for the success of the hybrid attacks by Palestinian resistance fighters against the Zionist regime was the flawless execution of missions by the security and protection forces of the resistance movement.

Of course, one reason for this success was the transfer of experiences in terms of security and protection fields from the battle of Thar Al-Ahrar Operation to the ongoing conflict of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, indicating an upgrade in strategic cooperation between Hamas and the Islamic Jihad movement in Palestine.

🔰 Al-Qassam Brigades Commander Announces Start Of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm

Commander-in-Chief of the Izz ad-Din Al-Qassam Brigades, Mohammed Deif, announced a military operation against Zionist settlements named Operation Al-Aqsa Storm, on October 7.

Deif called on Palestinians to rise up against Israel and declared that a major uprising had begun to end the Israeli occupation.

In his statement, Deif emphasized that the Israeli enemy had attacked women, while they were saying their prayers at Al-Aqsa Mosque and desecrated the sanctity of the holy site despite prior warnings by Palestinians.

The statement is as follows:

The occupying regime had also insulted the Prophet’s ascension site, and hundreds of Palestinians had been martyred or injured this year due to Zionist crimes.

The enemy had rejected our friendly humanitarian proposal for prisoner swap and continued its daily crimes on the southwestern coast.

We announce the beginning of Operation Al-Aqsa Storm.

We fired over 5,000 missiles and rockets towards the occupied territories. From today onwards, security cooperation between the Palestinian Authority and the Zionist enemy will end.

Today, the Palestinian nation is back on the path of uprising, resistance, and return.

We call on Jerusalem residents to rise up against the occupying enemy.

We urge residents of the occupied territories of 1948, including Negev, Galilee and al-Musalas to set fire to the ground under the feet of occupiers.

We call on our brothers in Islamic resistance movements in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria, and Yemen to support the resistance in Palestine.

It is time for united Arab resistance. We invite everyone to march towards Palestine.

The time has come to end the occupation.

We urge the Islamic and Arab nations to move towards the borders of Palestine.
