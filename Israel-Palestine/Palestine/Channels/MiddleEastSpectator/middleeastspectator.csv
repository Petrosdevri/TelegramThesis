On this day of great farewell to the two martyr leaders, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, we pray for their pure souls and remember their unwavering stances in support of Palestine and their great martyrdom on the path to Al-Quds.

As we bid farewell to these two great martyrs, the Secretary-Generals of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and Sayyed Hashem Safieddine, we in the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) renew our deepest condolences to the brotherly Lebanese people, and to our Arab and Islamic nations, asking Allah, the Almighty, to grant patience and solace to their families, their comrades in the leadership of the Islamic resistance, and to the resistance supporters everywhere.

On this solemn day, we recall the heroic and honorable stances of martyr Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, his firm and principled commitment to the Palestinian cause, and his determination to form a united front with our people in Gaza against the brutal zionist aggression and genocide war. He defied the occupation’s fascist threats, and as he always wished, he attained martyrdom in defense of his nation’s dignity and on the path to liberating Al-Quds.

We affirm that the zionist occupation’s crimes and cowardly assassinations of resistance leaders in Palestine, Lebanon, and beyond will never stop our struggle. Instead, they will only strengthen our resolve to continue on the path of our martyred leaders, until we eradicate this abhorrent occupation that threatens the entire region, reclaim our land and sanctities, and purify them from the filth of the zionist usurpers.""

Hinkle has been hosted by various media in the past few days, including Iran's Channel 3, Al-Mayadeen, and even Hezbollah's very own Al-Manar.

Now, we cannot assume anything about Jackson Hinkle without solid proof. Maybe his intentions are genuine, although I doubt that. However, I sincerely wish that our media were not so gullible, to let an American visit our institutions and meet sensitive places. This is a major security risk to say the least.

Especially if this American is connected to U.S. intelligence operatives, and openly praises President Trump, despite knowing very well that Trump supported the genocide in Gaza and ordered the killing of General Soleimani.

Besides, this is not my only issue with Hinke. He has used the Palestinian cause as a way to gain fame and wealth, and in my opinion, is a grifter of the highest order.

2025-02-21T02:43:01+00:00,-1001626824086,"— The strength of the Islamic resistance comes, first and foremost, from the support of its people.

I would like to take you all back to January 2020, when the Commander of the IRGC Quds Force, General Soleimani, was martyred in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

According to the Americans, the assassination was a massive success. They thought they had achieved a great victory. They eliminated Iran's most important general, and took out probably the most significant architect of Iran's regional power projection.

What they failed to realize, however, is that 'Martyr Soleimani' was a thousand times more powerful than 
'General Soleimani'.

More than 10 million people showed up for his funeral, in the biggest nationwide display of support for the Islamic Republic in years (pictures and videos attached).

The months prior, Iran had seen some tensions due to rising fuel prices and inflation, but the assassination of Qasem Soleimani brought the country together and reinvigorated the revolutionary spirit.

If Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah's funeral looks anything similar to it, of course when adjusted to Lebanon's population and scale, then this tragic event will only legitimize the resistance more, and embed it into the people's hearts even more. 

Sacrifice unites. Suffering and mourning for a loved one unites. Many people in Lebanon, even those who may not necessarily love Hezbollah, grew up with Nasrallah. They respect him in one way or another, and for this reason I expect a massive turnout this Sunday.

'Dear friends, in just a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event: the funeral of His Eminence, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and the martyrs who stood with him. 

We, from Jerusalem, stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices made by Sayyed Hassan and his companions, those who stood with Palestine, defended it, and paid a heavy price for it. We are loyal to these sacrifices. All Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of Sayyed Hassan and his comrades.

While we send our condolences from the heart of our holy city, we want to express that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it during the most difficult times and under the harshest conditions. Today, the Palestinian cause is being conspired against. Our enemies seek to displace our people and erase our cause. But the Palestinians will never raise the flag of surrender. We hold firmly to our rights, our principles, and our constants. The word 'surrender' has no place in our Palestinian dictionary.

Dear friends, we are all one family, one nation, facing the colonial projects that do not only target Palestine but the entire nation. Our message has always been, and will continue to be, that Palestine is the compass. Whoever’s compass is Palestine is in the right place, and whoever’s compass points elsewhere is in the wrong place. We urge them to correct their course and set their compass in the right direction.

Our dear friends, our message today is that we, as a community, must remain united, Christians and Muslims, across all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented, divided. They want us to speak the language of sectarianism. They want us divided so they can implement their projects, following the well-known adage 'divide and conquer.' They want to divide us so they can push forward their colonial projects that target Palestine and the entire nation.

We will remain Christians and Muslims in this region, one nation, with our compass pointing to Jerusalem, and our cause being Palestine. We must not allow anyone, or any entity, to push projects aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family, and that is how we have been, and how we will always remain.'

2025-02-18T14:50:49+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Some thoughts about True Promise-1 and True Promise-2, which I have been waiting to share for a long time

I want you all to understand, before True Promise-1 happened, nobody was even expecting Iran to strike Israel directly, including myself.

Forget about the 'results' for a moment, that's a different story. Take yourself back to the weeks before April 14th 2024 – nobody, literally NOBODY thought Iran would attack Israel.

Within Iran, and the wider political sphere, the discussion was initially about the possibility of taking 'reciprocal action' to the destruction of the Iranian embassy in Syria. Meaning, they were considering the option of striking Israel's embassies or facilities abroad, such as in Jordan or Azerbaijan.

Mind you, many analysts believed that even THIS was too much to expect from us, and that we should simply strike 'Israeli-linked assets' like Mossad safehouses in Erbil, Iraq, like we did in the past.

In the days leading up to April 14th, when the conversation and news reporting started shifting to the possibility of a direct Iranian strike on Israeli territory, many people did not believe it, and personally I considered it unlikely. At that point, due to past weaknesses shown, I (and many others) would have been more than satisfied with merely a strike on an Israeli embassy.

Even when, in my mind, I entertained the possibility of a direct strike, I expected Iran to strike in 'Israeli-held' territory, such as the Golan Heights, while technically and legally avoiding actual 'Israeli' territory (Golan Heights are Syrian in Intl. Law).

But no. Not only did Iran strike Israel directly, it struck them in the heartland – deep in the Negev, directly targeting airbases. And of course, in True Promise-2, we saw the targeting of Tel Nof airbase in Tel Aviv itself.

People must understand, while these attacks were certainly impressive from a military POV (especially TP-2), the effect of these operations is not actually measured by the amount of damage or the amount of Israeli fatalities.

These operations set a new equation, they started a new era, and they changed the entire political landscape. They set a precedent for the future. That is the real significance of True Promise-1 and True Promise-2. Iran got the first taste of direct conflict with Israel, and it learned many important things.

As for the military aspect, TP-1 was widely telegraphed and was clearly intended as a message to Israel and the world, this is obvious considering the fact that Iran mostly used small amounts of old missiles and hundreds of drones they knew would be intercepted.

In regards to TP-2, it was a probing attack. It was not telegraphed, it was sudden. They intended to do limited damage, this time showing Israel that Iran has a true 'will' to use force, without it being excessive enough for an overwhelming Israeli response. 

At the same time, this attack utilized some of Iran's advanced weapons for the first time, such as Fattah-1, and the operation taught Iran how many missiles it would need to reasonable assure itself of a significant level of destruction of Israeli airbases. The conclusion? More missiles needed, liquid fueled missiles need their accuracy improved, and we need larger warheads.

So next time someone brings up these operations, you must understand the complex reality we live in. Neither Iran nor Israel went 'full-out' during last year's exchange. Both are probing and testing. But a large scale conflict will, eventually, happen.

As for True Promise-3, sometimes it is better to wait. It was a time of action, but for now it is a time of making sure that we know what we're getting ourselves into, before we start the next cycle of conflict. As the Leader said: 'We neither rush nor delay'.

Every step can be your last, so make sure your next step is the right one.

This makes it more than clear, the Palestinian resistance still sees Iran as its key ally, probably even more than before.

Contrary to armchair generals and excessive hype in the media, neither Hamas nor the PIJ ever even expected Iran to directly intervene after October 7th. 

The fact that Iran directly struck Israel twice was a positive surprise to them, and it solidified their alliance more than before.

The nature of these attacks could be such that Hezbollah could maintain a level of ambiguity, and they may not officially take response for the attacks.

But at this point, who knows what's going to happen. They could also just declare it openly & continue the campaign. But if they do, like I said, it's likely Hezbollah will focus on expelling the IDF from Lebanon, and it won't target Israel internally.

'People say: Look at Russia, it was a paper tiger, it's been three years and look how slow they progressed.

I ask anyone, with a genuine ounce of intellect, to look at the situation objectively. The Russians, for three years, have been advancing slowly and methodically in Ukraine. At the same time, they are conserving their economy to a large extent.

If the Russians would have gone all-out, what an effect on the economy would this have had? Do you understand the implications of full mobilization? This is a delicate balance.

Why should they sacrifice their domestic situation in order to get a quick victory, if they can sit, lean back, and complete the marathon? Additionally, Russia has taken every possible measure to avoid civilian casualties, unlike Kiev. Of course, this also impacts the effectiveness on the battlefield.

Lastly, look at the backers of Ukraine, and look at Russia. We Iranians know what it feels like to fight an enemy whom the whole world has rallied behind. This is what is now taking place in Ukraine. Although, of course, some countries here and there have provided Russia with limited support.

Iran emphasizes the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, in a way that is most suitable in the interest of both parties.'

2025-02-10T15:12:42+00:00,-1001626824086,"🔯🇺🇸 NEW | Channel 12 Hebrew: Recently, foreign media outlets and several Israeli media reported that the United States intends to transfer its most powerful non-nuclear bomb, known as the ""Mother of All Bombs,"" to ""Israel."" However, despite the publications on this subject, no Israeli official has confirmed this report, and in fact, the Israeli Air Force does not have a single fighter jet capable of carrying this bomb.

The Israeli Air Force does have C-130 transport aircraft that can carry this bomb, but unlike Afghanistan, where the Taliban did not have the operational capability to threaten American aircraft, the targets for which ""Israel"" needs these bombs are protected by heavy air defense systems.

The chance of success for a Israeli transport aircraft carrying a bomb weighing 11 tons, with its limited maneuvering ability, turns any idea of such a mission into a suicidal mission.

In his speech today, the Supreme Leader once again emphasized that negotiating with the U.S. is not of any benefit to the Iranian nation:

'For some time now, you have been hearing, in newspapers, in cyberspace, and in the words of various people, that there is discussion about negotiations with America.

They mention the word 'negotiation', saying, 'Sir, negotiation is a good thing,' as if someone is opposed to the goodness of negotiation. Today, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is one of the busiest foreign ministries globally. That is its job, after all. It negotiates with countries around the world — Eastern, Western, all kinds — it travels back and forth, speaks, and signs agreements.

The exception that exists is America. Of course, I do not mention the Zionist regime because it is not a real country. The Zionist regime is a gang of criminals who came and occupied a land and are committing crimes. That is not a subject of discussion. The exception is America. Why is it an exception? What is the reason?

Negotiating with America has no effect on solving the country's problems. We must understand this. They should not make it seem as if sitting at the table with that government will solve this or that problem. No, not at all.

No problem is solved through negotiations with America. The reason? Experience. In the 2010's, we sat down and negotiated with America for about two years. A treaty was formed with them (JCPOA).

Our government sat down and negotiated. They went, came, sat, stood, negotiated, talked, laughed, shook hands, became friends — they did everything. A treaty was formed. In this treaty, the Iranian side was very generous. It gave many concessions to the other side. But the Americans did not implement the treaty.

The very person who is now in office [Trump] tore up this treaty. He said, 'I will tear it up,' and he did. Even before he came, those with whom this treaty was signed did not implement it. The treaty was meant to lift U.S. sanctions. The U.S. sanctions were not lifted at all.

We should learn from this experience. We gave concessions, we negotiated, we compromised, but we did not achieve any result. That is what happened. Even this treaty, with all the concessions we gave, was still undermined, violated, and torn apart by the other side. 

Negotiating with such a government should not be done. Negotiation with them is neither wise, nor intelligent, nor honorable. We must solve our problems internally, not relying on outside factors.

As for the Americans, they comment on us, they talk, they express their opinions, they issue threats. If they threaten us, we will threaten them. If they carry out their threat, we will carry out our threat as well. If they violate the security of our nation, we will undoubtedly violate their security as well. This is our duty.'

The ceasefire has been violated for weeks, in almost every sense of the word, and in any other situation, Hezbollah would have responded by now. But the reality is, they are exhausted after more than a year of war, and in the new political environment in Lebanon their position is even more fragile.

Hezbollah needs to preserve the majority of its capabilities in case of a larger regional war, it needs to focus on rebuilding, it cannot afford to restart the war at this moment, especially with  their supply lines uncertain and a threat from Syria simultaneously.

Besides, the entire reason for entering the war against Israel was to be a support front for Gaza, which doesn't apply anymore. But it looks like the Israelis are perhaps looking to continue the war, both in Gaza and in Lebanon, emboldened by Trump.

Nizari Ismaeli Shiites believe that he was their 49th infallible Imam, a physical representative of God on earth, descending directly from the Prophet Muhammad ‎ﷺ. He was born in Geneva in 1936, and ascended to the Imamate in 1957. 

With an estimated net worth of over $15 Billion USD, Agha Khan IV was one of the richest faith leaders in the entire world.

Ismaeli Shiites make up less than 1% of the Shiite population, the other 99% being the Twelvers ('Imamis', found mostly in Iran, Iraq, Bahrain, etc.) and Seveners ('Zaidis', found mostly in Yemen). These two groups consider Ismaelis to be disbelievers, as they have omitted several pillars of Islam over the years.

Among other things, Ismaeli Shiites do not believe in prayer being obligatory, and they do not believe in fasting during Ramadan. They also believe the Quran was time-bound, and that it is irrelevant today. Their 'Imam' has been seen dancing with women and consuming alcohol.

'To the Al-Qassam fighters,  
My name is Keith Siegel and I am from Gaza.  

From October 7, 2023, I was in Gaza until January 2025...  

The fighters who guarded me during this time were diligent in meeting all my needs for food, drink, medicine, vitamins, glasses, a blood pressure monitor, and other necessities. They also brought me a doctor when I felt unwell for a prolonged period.  

The guards responded to my requests regarding food and other dietary issues. They ensured that I received food suitable for my health condition (vegetarian food and without butter).  

The guards treated me well.  
I believe that the Israeli government has not done what is required to reach a deal for the return of the prisoners and to end the war, which has led to many casualties and excessive damage to both sides. I hope peace will be achieved soon.  

I would like to extend special thanks to the fighters who ensured my safety during this time,

It also appears that the 30N6E2 engagement and fire control radar has been removed from its deployment location, and the 64N6E2 target acquisition and battlefield management radar has been deployed in its location; however, there is no change in the status of the 96L6E detection and interception radar. In any case, it can be said that the above site was in a non-operational state when the image was recorded.

– S-300PMU-2 Kahrizak Defense Site: According to the latest available satellite image of this defense site, the PT85TE2 vehicles carrying the S-300 system launchers (except for one launcher) have left their deployment location. It also appears that the 30N6E2 engagement and fire control radar has left its deployment location. An 30N6E2 engagement radar can be seen in a non-operational state and under a camouflage net. The 64N6E2 target acquisition and battlefield management radar has also left its deployment site. However, by observing the 96L6E detection and interception radar antenna, it appears that the above radar is in an operational state. Also, in the southern part of this defensive site, two 96L6E detection and interception radars are observed in a collected and non-operational state. In any case, and with the absence of launcher vehicles and the absence of an engagement radar in the composition of this air defense site, it can be said that the above site was in a non-operational state at the time the image was recorded.

– Islamshahr Defense Site:
The above site was equipped with an MIM-23 Hawk defense system until the publication of a satellite image on October 30th. Based on the October 30th satellite image (4 days after the attack), it was determined that the Hawk launchers had been dismantled from the site, and two PT85TE2 launchers of the S-300PMU-2 system, along with the 30N6E2 engagement and fire control radar and a communication relay vehicle, were deployed at the Islamshahr site. According to the latest available image, these launchers are still present at the site, but the 30N6E2 engagement radar is not visible in its location (however, the generators are in place). The site is operational.

– Qader Ahvaz Early Warning Radar: According to the image above, after the generator / control center buildings of the Qader Ahvaz site were targeted, the buildings and the radar receiver / transmitter platform of this radar site were dismantled, and accordingly, as of the date of recording this satellite image, the Qader Ahvaz radar site is in a non-operational state.

This shit happened 3x worse, every single day, for almost one and a half years. And it was mostly women and children, being literally blown to pieces. Their family members collected their limbs in plastic bags. And the majority of Americans didn't care. So please, spare me the crocodile tears.

We can never talk enough about the unspeakable massacres that were committed in Gaza. Even if we talked about it an entire lifetime, it wouldn't be enough. It wouldn't even scratch the surface. But after a while, we all just started to pretend it was normal, because there was nothing else we could do.

2025-01-30T04:13:49+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇺🇸 Fact: 

Even if all passengers onboard both aircraft died (64 + 3 = 67), and if such a crash happened every single day for the next 1000 days, non-stop, it would still not reach the amount of Palestinians killed in Gaza by Israel from Oct 7th 2023 to October 2024 (estimated to be at least 70,000).

Just imagine that. Such a large, tragic crash, killing 67 people in a single day, STILL wouldn't be enough to reach the number of people that were killed in Gaza within JUST 1 year, even if it happened EVERY SINGLE DAY for the next 1000 days.

To illustrate it more: At least 151 Palestinians were killed every single day in Gaza from Oct 7th 2023 to October 2024. That's nearly 3x the amount of this crash, daily.

I'm not saying this to take away the importance of these innocent lives lost. I'm mentioning this so maybe the American people can finally have a moment of realization, what happened in Gaza is truly more tragic than anything seen in our lifetime.

Israel is a cancerous tumor that only survives being artificially propped up by its puppet masters in the United States, and it must be eradicated from the face of the earth.

Israelis are not a thing. They are Jews from Poland, Russia, Germany, America, and other places. They have no connection to the land they so claim to love. The moment they sense insecurity, they leave, because they have places to go back to where they really came from, in Europe, America and elsewhere. 

Palestinians, on the other hand, will never leave. The land is theirs. Their fathers, mothers, grandfathers, grandmothers, and tens of generations of ancestors were born and grew up in this land. They stayed in times of disaster, famine, mass killings, and genocide. Because they belong in this land. Nothing can take it from them.

Once again, this shows that Donald Trump has no clue what he's talking about. He probably saw Israel's air defenses, heard the word 'Iron Dome' and thought 'YES, I WANT THAT!', but that's not how it works.

First of all, the 'Iron Dome' is not the generic name of a network of air defense systems, it's one specific system, which operates in unison with other missile defense platforms. 

The Israeli Iron Dome platform is meant to counter short-range rockets, missiles and artillery. It was specifically designed to help defend Israel from Hezbollah, Hamas and other armed groups on its borders, which mostly use short-range non-ballistic rockets. 

For any medium to long-range projectiles and ballistic missiles, Israel uses other defense systems, such as the Arrow-2, Arrow-3, and David Sling. 

When Trump says he wants to build an 'Iron Dome', he's probably talking about a more generic and long-range missile defense system. Because the Iron Dome would be almost totally useless in the US, as there are no armed groups on its borders that pose a significant threat in terms of short-range rockets and artillery. 

Besides, the United States is far too big to cover it with such an extensive missile defense network as Israel. Trump just heard a buzzword and now he wants to do it. That's how things will be from now on.

These exercises are apparently meant mainly in order to prepare Iranian troops for possible deployment in Central Asia, to guard China's 'Belt and Road Initiative', in case of need.

Iran has been fortifying its ties with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and other Central Asian nations recently, and the Belt and Road Initiative will contribute massively to the Iranian economy.

We will see. Personally, if I had to guess, I'd be betting on Armenia for the most likely deployment in the near future."

It seems the 35th Special Forces Brigade and the 55th Airborne Brigade received the same modernizations as we saw in the 65th NOHED brigade during last week's exercise: Body armor, new helmets (+ NVG option) & 'Masaf' assault rifles based on US models.

It is great to see that the Iranian Army is now starting to receive modernization for personal equipment on a large scale. For years, the ground forces had been neglected, to the point where many soldiers did not even have helmets.

'The 60-day period for the Zionist enemy to withdraw from Lebanese territory permanently is about to end, which necessitates its full and comprehensive implementation in accordance with what was stated in the ceasefire agreement. 

There are some leaks that talk about the enemy postponing its withdrawal and intending to stay longer in Lebanon: We call on everyone, especially the political authorities in Lebanon, and by pressuring the countries sponsoring the agreement, to move effectively to keep up with the last days of the deadline in a way that ensures the implementation of the full withdrawal of the IDF and the deployment of the Lebanese Army to every last inch of Lebanese territory, and the return of the people to their villages quickly, and not to allow any pretexts or arguments to prolong the occupation. 

Any exceeding the 60-day deadline is considered a blatant violation of the agreement and an insistence on encroaching on Lebanese sovereignty, this would enter a new chapter of the occupation that requires the Lebanese state to deal with it by all means and methods necessary by international charters in all their chapters to restore the land and wrestle it away from the clutches of the occupation.

While we will follow the developments of the situation that is supposed to culminate in the coming days with a complete withdrawal, any breach of the agreement and its clauses, and any attempt to escape from them under flimsy pretexts, will not be acceptable, and we call for a strict commitment with no concessions.'

I mean come on, we all know Trump isn't the one writing these Executive Orders, or coming up with these ideas (the $500 Million USD 'StarGate' thing is so obviously a Musk inception).

This is how it works in the United States. The President's close advisors or cabinet members write up the policy, Trump simply puts his signature (or doesn't). 

While Trump, like any other modern American President, is inherently an enemy to most non-Western (and especially Middle Eastern) nations by virtue of his Zionist ventriloquists, I do think there is one positive point about him: He's stubborn regarding his anti-war views.

Not because he cares about the wellbeing of other nations or societies, but because he's obsessed with the way he is perceived in the media and at home. Trump wants to be seen as someone who puts America first, someone who doesn't put U.S. troops in harms way, and someone who doesn't get involved in endless wars like his many predecessors.

This is why I think that Trump's advisors will find it very hard to convince him to go to war with Iran. John Bolton and Mike Pompeo tried extremely hard to convince him during his first term, but they were ultimately (and luckily) ignored. 

Now, most of these anti-Iran war hawks, with the notable exception of newly appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have either been removed from the administration completely, or have had their security clearance revoked in a recent executive order. This shows me that Trump is extremely hesitant to get involved in warmongering.

While he may give Israel the Green Light to carry out acts of aggression against Iran, I doubt the U.S. would get directly involved in actual warfare, unless Israel was at risk of existential danger, in which case all measures necessary will be taken to defend it. 

And in my opinion, Trump will do whatever he can to prevent an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear facilities. Oil refineries or other infrastructure he may allow, but he knows that a strike on nuclear sites will lead to war, which he wants to prevent at all costs, especially after being praised as a peacemaker for the Gaza ceasefire.

2025-01-15T17:40:10+00:00,-1001626824086,"— Some are asking about the tremendous sacrifice. They are wondering, was it all worth it?

Standing up for truth, justice, and humanity is always worth it. Regardless of how much blood is spilled, how many martyrs we gave, how many mothers cried. None of this suffering is in vain, because this blood was shed on the path of God, in a battle between good and evil, a battle between truth and falsehood.

People may ask, what did it achieve? The full extent of the consequences of the war in Gaza and Lebanon for the Zionist regime will not be known until long into the future. The repercussions on Israel's internal political situation and the economic situation will likely reverberate within the next few years. Eilat port is bankrupt, thousands of Israelis are dead or wounded, and hundreds of thousands of settlers in the North are still displaced. And remember, Israel was on the brink of civil war before all of this even began.

But one thing is for sure: The Palestinian cause has been revived throughout the world. More youths and people of all walks of life have opened their eyes than ever before. Israel is a pariah state. Hamas is operational, Hezbollah is operational. Israeli troops will withdraw from Gaza, as well as from Lebanon.

As the famous Zionist-U.S. foreign policy 'prodigy' Henry Kissinger said himself: 'The conventional army loses if he does not win. The guerilla wins if he does not lose.'

Hamas did not lose. Hezbollah did not lose. Therefore, they have won, despite facing an enemy vastly superior in military strength.

Resistance movements don't count their achievements based on the rate of casualties, material losses, or level of destruction. As long as they continue to resist, they are victorious. And truly, all praise belongs to God Almighty.

The armored vehicles and tanks are apparently stationed in 'Zone C', a designation originating in the 1979 Camp David Accords, the peace treaty between Israel and Egypt.

According to the treaty, Egypt is only allowed to station 22,000 troops, tanks and artillery pieces in 'Zone A', 4,000 infantry troops in 'Zone B', and only Egyptian civilian police & UN forces are allowed in 'Zone C'. 

By stationing regular troops and even main battle tanks in Zone C, Egypt continues its subtle re-militarization of the Sinai Peninsula, which has gone largely under the radar.

This comes in response to Israel's violation of the agreement after October 7th, when the IDF deployed tanks to 'Zone D', also known as the 'Philadelphi Axis'. According to the Camp David Accords, Israel is not allowed to have tanks in Zone D, but the war in Gaza has been used as a pretext to violate this clause.

2025-01-11T15:46:52+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇬🇧/🇮🇱/🇵🇸 NEW: A recently published study by prestigious British medical journal 'The Lancet' suggests vastly more civilian deaths from Israeli airstrikes in Gaza than initially estimated by Gaza's Health Ministry

The study, which was conducted by using a statistical analysis of hospital data, obituaries on social media, and an online enquiry, indicates that approximately 64,260 Palestinians were killed by Israel in Gaza during just the first nine months of the war (October 2023 – July 2024).

This is a staggering 41% more fatalities than the official number published for the same time period by Gaza's Health Ministry.

The study also indicates that at least 59% of the fatalities from Israeli airstrikes consist of women, children, and and people older than 65. The researchers only looked at deaths directly resulting from Israeli bombardments, not indirect casualties as a result of lack of food, medicine or clean drinking water.

Last October, a large group of American and other Western doctors that worked in Gaza's health sector already wrote an open letter to the international community, stating that they estimate the real death toll to be much higher than the official number, and that they estimate it to be well above 100,000 fatalities.

Pezeshkian's government spokeswoman said that they are examining plans to move the capital more towards the Persian Gulf coast so that transporting raw materials to / from the capital would be less resource-demanding, but there is absolutely no basis for this and it will never happen. 

It costs too much money, and it is not logistically feasible either. It would take massive amounts of resources and decades to complete. For a country like Iran, already under sanctions & with a weak economy, this is simply impossible.

Former President Rouhani proposed it, Ahmadinejad also thought about it, but it is a dumb idea and neither the parliament nor the Supreme Leader will accept it. It won't even pass the examination stage. 

You need to understand that in Iran, especially during the Pezeshkian government, spokespersons may say some random stuff that in reality has 0% chance of actually happening. 

The government spokeswoman, Fatemeh Mohajerani, even mentions this herself: 'This issue is in an exploratory phase, we will first see if it is feasible. It is not urgent.'

2025-01-09T00:04:12+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇦🇫 ❌🇸🇦 NEW: The Ministry of Information and Culture of the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan (Taliban-ruled Afghanistan) has issued a list of books that will be banned, including 'Kitab Al-Tawheed'

This is good news for Afghanistan & for Islam as a whole, as it shows that the Taliban is taking a clear stance against Wahhabism, and steps towards mainstream Islam.

Kitab Al-Tawheed, ('The Book of Monotheism'), is a famous work by the 18th century Islamic scholar Muhammad Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab, the spiritual founder of the radical Wahhabi stream of Islam, which lies at the root of most terrorist groups that have emerged in the 20th and 21st centuries, such as ISIS, Al-Nusrah, and Al-Qaeda. 

Muhammad Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab was an ultra-fundamentalist reformer who sought to 'return Islam to its original state', expanding on the works of earlier scholars such as Ibn Taymiyyah, who was repeatedly jailed during his lifetime for being too controversial and going against traditional Sunni Islamic scholarship.

In 1744, Muhammad Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab made a pact with the Emir of Dir'iyya, Imam Muhammad Bin Saud, which eventually led to the establishment of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.

In this pact, the house of Saud agreed to implement and expand the Wahhabi doctrine of Islam within its Kingdom and outside its borders, in exchange for Islamic scholars associated with the Wahhabi movement guaranteeing the legitimacy of the House of Saud's rule over the Hejaz, the Islamic holy land containing Mecca and Medina, located in modern-day Saudi Arabia.

A fact that needs to be thoroughly understood, is that Wahhabism was tacitly supported by the West, especially Britain, as the ideology focused mostly on dividing and criticizing fellow Muslims, and less on confronting colonial / hegemonic powers in the region. This can still be seen in the modern day, where most Wahhabi groups do not prioritize fighting against the West or Israel.

From the end of the 20th century onwards, this new extremist ideology was spread across the globe, financed by Saudi oil money & supported by the West, filling the Madrassas (Islamic Seminaries) in countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Egypt, Tunisia, and others, which led to an entire generation of radical Wahhabi scholars that influenced the masses and moved millions of Muslims away from mainstream Islam towards radical thought. This laid the foundation of 'Islamic' terrorism in the modern age.

From 1744 until this day, the pact of Dir'iyya remains intact, and Wahhabism is still the most prevalent Islamic school of thought inside Saudi Arabia, despite some minor amendments and liberalization. If you have heard of 'Salafism', this is simply a re-branded name for Wahhabism, and it still extremely influential throughout the world.

2025-01-07T00:05:18+00:00,-1001626824086,"— Fatwa from the Supreme Religious Authority, Ayatollah Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei:

Q: 'Some Muslims celebrate certain religious holidays that Christians also celebrate (like Christmas), is there any problem with this?'

A: 'In itself, there is nothing wrong with celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ (peace be upon him). However, it should not be done in a way that promotes the degenerate culture of the West, or in a way that entails corruption / sinning or deviating from our (Islamic) beliefs.'

In other words, while we as Muslims do not recognize December 25th or January 7th as the authentic legitimate birth dates of Jesus Christ, there is no problem with being happy or rejoicing for his birth, because Jesus is a beloved Prophet of God. However, celebrating Christmas in a religious sense, and in a way that entails deviating from the Islamic doctrine, is forbidden.

This includes things like going to church, proclaiming that Jesus is God (or the Son of God), believing that Jesus was truly born on Christmas day, and so on. 

But in general, things like gathering with family members, exchanging gifts, or wishing Christian friends a Merry Christmas entails no issues from an Islamic perspective.

2024-12-23T06:55:43+00:00,-1001626824086,"— ❗️🇺🇸/🇩🇪/🇸🇦 RIDICULOUS: Elon Musk, CEO of X, now claims that ex-Muslim Far-Right Atheist terrorist Taleb Al Abdulmohsen actually WAS a Muslim, citing Maral Salmassi, a Germany-based Iranian ultra-Zionist 

Salmassi claims that Taleb Al Abdulmohsen was LYING, and that ALL of his Tweets against Islam & pro-Israel were actually done under the Shia Islamic practice of Taqiyyah, in order to secretly 'advance Islamic interests', which is simply laughable.

Not only does this imply that Taleb Al Abdulmohsen was planning this terrorist attack for years upon years, which is extremely unlikely due to the erratic nature of his Tweets, it also completely disregards the reality of the concept of Taqiyya in Shia Islam.

Taqiyyah in Shia Islam is not 'lying and deception to advance Islamic objectives', it is the act of concealing one's true faith or beliefs when under threat of death or under severe persecution. For example, if ISIS asks: 'Are you Shia Muslim?', you are allowed to lie and say no, in order to protect your own life. It does NOT permit lying to 'advance Islamic goals' or anything else. Besides, when has a Shia Muslim ever comitted a terrorist attack in Germany? The whole narrative makes zero sense.

Elon Musk claims the legacy press is 'pure propaganda', while he HIMSELF deleted the account of the terrorist in order to wipe his pro-Israel, pro-Elon Musk & anti-Islamic track record. And he HIMSELF vigorously promotes only the Jewish-backed narrative on X, while discounting any real criticism.

If Elon Musk cared about the truth, why does he not amplify unbiased accounts on X? Why is it always ultra-Zionist bootlickers, who clearly have a horse in the race and have a vested interest in pushing a certain narrative? For God's sake, not only is Maral Salmassi a pro-Israeli Iranian diaspora, she's not even an academic at the very least! She made her career as a musician & is now an anti-Islamic activist. Where is the bare minimum credibility?

Every day, Elon Musk reveals his true nature more and more. If X really supported free speech and independent analysis, they would not have banned Taleb Al Abdulmohsen's original account & wiped all of the dozens of messages where he openly and clearly supported the AfD, Israel, and other Far-Right causes, including calling Judaism the 'religion of God'.

On the one hand, Iran's Supreme Leader has repeatedly stressed the need to retaliate for the Israeli attack on Iranian territory which killed 4 air defense personnel back in October. In addition to this, the Iranian leadership reportedly considers the risk of another Israeli attack to be 'high', especially after the ceasefire in Lebanon. Israel has openly said it will take the battle to Iran.

According to one high-ranking U.S. official, Iran is 'probably willing to take preemptive measures', both in order to carry out its promised retaliation and to preempt any possible upcoming Israeli attack. 

The Iranian military leadership and political echelon, according to the U.S. official, has now concluded that only a more aggressive and proactive posture will sufficiently deter Israel, and is willing to carry out a large scale attack 'even if it leads to war'.

Statement: 'Our armed forces succeeded in thwarting an American-British attack against our country, as the aircraft carrier USS Harry S. Truman and a number of its warships were targeted during the start of the the enemy's aggression last night against our country.

The operation was carried out with eight cruise missiles and 17 drones. 

The operation, with the help of God Almighty, led to the following:

- First: Shooting down an American F/A-18F 'Super Hornet' jet while the warships were trying to confront the Yemeni drones and missiles.

- Second: Most of the enemy warplanes left Yemeni airspace for international waters in the Red Sea to defend the aircraft carrier while it was being targeted.

But sadly, the hope for this is very little. People with this mentality barely exist inside Egypt. This is even more likely in Jordan than in Egypt, which says a lot.

If Sisi is overthrown, there will likely be chaos, probably some Western-backed Islamists, or even worse, Liberals, will overthrow him. And that will only make Egypt LESS of a threat to Israel.

2024-12-16T12:44:54+00:00,-1001626824086,"—❗️🇸🇾 BREAKING: Former President Bashar al-Assad has released his first statement

'As terrorism spread across Syria and ultimately reached Damascus on the evening of Saturday, 7th of December 2024, questions arose about the president's fate and whereabouts. 

This occurred amidst a flood of misinformation and narratives far removed from the truth, aimed at recasting international terrorism as a liberation revolution for Syria.

At such a critical juncture in the nation's history, where truth must take precedence, it is essential to address these distortions. Unfortunately, the prevailing circumstances at the time, including a total communication blackout for security reasons, delayed the release of this statement. This does not replace a detailed account of the events that unfolded, which will be provided when the opportunity allows.

First, my departure from Syria was neither planned nor did it occur during the final hours of the battles, as some have claimed. On the contrary, I remained in Damascus, carrying out my duties until the early hours of Sunday 8th of December 2024. As terrorist forces infiltrated Damascus, I moved to Lattakia in coordination with our Russian allies to oversee combat operations. 

Upon arrival at the Hmeimim airbase that morning, it became clear that our forces had completely withdrawn from all battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen. As the field situation in the area continued to deteriorate, the Russian military base itself came under intensified attack by drone strikes. With no viable means of leaving the base, Moscow requested that the base's command arrange an immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday 8th of December. 

This took place a day after the fall of Damascus, following the collapse of the last military positions and the resulting paralysis of all remaining state institutions. At no point during these events did I consider stepping down or seeking refuge, nor was such a proposal made by any individual or party. The only course of action was to continue fighting against the terrorist onslaught.

I reaffirm that the person who, from the very first day of the war, refused to barter the salvation of his nation for personal gain, or to compromise his people in exchange for numerous offers and enticements is the same person who stood alongside the officers and soldiers of the army on the front lines, just meters from terrorists in the most dangerous and intense battlefields. He is the same person who, during the darkest years of the war, did not leave but remained with his family alongside his people, confronting terrorism under bombardment and the recurring threats of terrorist incursions into the capital over fourteen years of war. 

Furthermore, the person who has never abandoned the resistance in Palestine and Lebanon, nor betrayed his allies who stood by him, cannot possibly be the same person who would forsake his own people or betray the army and nation to which he belongs.

I have never sought positions for personal gain but have always considered myself as a custodian of a national project, supported by the faith of the Syrian people, who believed in its vision. I have carried an unwavering conviction in their will and ability to protect the state, defend its institutions, and uphold their choices to the very last moment.

When the state falls into the hands of terrorism and the ability to make a meaningful contribution is lost, any position becomes void of purpose, rendering its occupation meaningless. 

This does not, in any way, diminish my profound sense of belonging to Syria and her people - a bond that remains unshaken by any position or circumstance. It is a belonging filled with hope that Syria will once again be free and independent.'

The UN Security Council, the international community, and all Arab and Islamic nations bear the responsibility to reject and end this aggression and to protect the Syrian people at this critical juncture in their history.

We have consistently warned against Israeli ambitions in the region, and have resisted them to prevent the occupation from achieving its goals. We have repeatedly emphasized that the aggression against Gaza is a war of annihilation and a launchpad for changing the face of the region and ending the Palestinian cause once and for all.

The deafening silence of the Arab, Islamic, and international communities in the face of this criminal aggression against Syria, which persists with unlimited American support, and the failure to take practical steps to confront this aggression and support the Palestinian people and their legitimate rights, have led to Israeli intransigence and encroachment on the countries of the region.

All necessary steps must be taken to prevent the Israeli entity from achieving its goals, and we cannot remain silent or indifferent to this heinous aggression against Syria and its people. 

What is happening in Syria today at the popular and political levels, and the resulting domestic and foreign political choices, are the exclusive right of the Syrian people, and this should be free from any external influences or pressures.

We hope that Syria will settle on the choices of its people, achieve its renaissance, and be in a position to reject the Israeli occupation and prevent foreign interference in its affairs.

We will continue to stand by Syria and its people in their right to shape their future and confront their enemy, the usurping Israeli entity.'

– Turkey is a part of NATO, and we should not see or accept the presence of this country and its influence anywhere outside of America and Europe. Turkey is a part of them, and with this attitude, it serves America. America is active behind the scenes.

– It seems that the factions present in Syria will clash with each other based on their own different interests. Maybe separating Syria is Turkey's desire, because they have been coveting a part of Syria for a long time.

2024-12-10T02:30:23+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇱/🇸🇾/🇱🇧 So, basically 4 reasons that could explain this Israeli maneuver:

1. They want to flank Hezbollah and enter Lebanon from the East, which would mean the continuation of the war in Lebanon & a massive level of escalation not seen before. 

2. They want to cut off 'Highway 1', the Damascus-Beirut Highway, in order to stop shipments of Iranian weapons to Hezbollah through Syria, which is unlikely considering that HTS / SNA will probably not allow these shipments regardless. But maybe Israel simply distrusts the rebels to that extent & want to make sure on their own.

3. They for some reason want to capture Damascus. At that point it would just be a plain 'landgrab' to expand Greater Israel, they have no legitimate reason to do this. Even the West would almost certainly condemn it.

4. They're just trolling everyone by advancing along the Lebanese border & near Damascus, and in reality they only care about establishing a security zone or a Druze state in the South of Syria in Daraa & Suwayda. (Or, in real terms, they want to be positioned near Lebanon 'JUST IN CASE' they need to carry out point 1. or 2.)

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-12-10T02:15:20+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇱/🇸🇾/🇱🇧/🇱🇧 Regarding the Israeli Ground Maneuver in Western Syria:

If I were Hezbollah, I'd be looking at this  maneuver very closely right now. If Hezbollah's leadership estimates that Israel will make an unexpected flanking maneuver to enter Lebanon through Syria, then it's best to take preemptive action and take the battle to Syria, or at least take precautionary measures and deploy some squads to the mountainous border area – and they might already be doing that as we speak.

That is, assuming Israel's goal for this maneuver in Syria actually is Lebanon. Because to be honest, I don't see any other reason for them to be pushing this much Northward along the Lebanese border area. Lebanon has to be their goal somehow.

If invading Lebanon is not their goal, then there are only two other scenarios I can think of that Israel might be aiming for. One is cutting the Damascus-Beirut highway near Yafour, which makes little sense considering that Israel has no reason to be worried about Hezbollah shipments from rebel-controlled Syria to Lebanon for now.

The other scenario, which would be a major 'WTF' moment, is that Israel will actually try to capture Damascus for whatever reason. I highly doubt they will, but if they simply wanted to create a Security Zone in Syria or even an independent Druze state, there would be no need to move this far up North, they could simply push for Daraa & Suwayda. 

So, as I stated, it is far more likely that Netanyahu wants to continue the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon by flanking from the East (Syria), possibly advancing into the Beqaa or even Beirut. If this is indeed their goal, then they're planning for a very large war, which will likely draw in Iran directly.

In my opion, Israel favors its chances currently. Assad just fell, Trump is about to take office, and Iran under Pezeshkian is not as assertive as it was several months ago. There may never be a better 'opportunity' for Israel to go 'all-in' regarding Lebanon (& maybe even Iran) than now.

2024-12-09T16:02:47+00:00,-1001626824086,"🇸🇾 - The Syrian National Socialist Party has issued a statement, commenting on the recent developments and the fall of the Assad Regime [click to expand]:
Following the various pivotal events that occurred after Operation Flood of Al-Aqsa, from aggression and genocide in occupied Palestine, and an attempt to invade Lebanon and eliminate its resistance, the event inside Syria came to have a strong impact on the region.

In this context, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party emphasizes the following:

1- As a result of the fall of the former regime, it is necessary to work to find an acceptable and appropriate solution for all our people in the Levant by creating an authority emanating from the will of the Syrians themselves, which governs the country and preserves the unity of its lands, society and interests, preserves institutions and consolidates the concept of citizenship and the national state, as well as defining for itself a clear and fixed compass, which is Palestine.

2- The Syrian Social Nationalist Party stresses that it is the duty of all national forces and every Syrian citizen to work to confront the Jewish invasion of southern Syria, in defense of the land, homeland and people, which cannot be liberated without a combat doctrine that is the basis for a national army that preserves the state and protects its lands, people and institutions. 

3- The party confirms that the institution of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is based on a 93-year-old doctrine that transcends any system and is not linked to any authority or state, as the party derives its presence and legitimacy from the struggles of the nationalists and our people and it remains and continues on Saadeh's path. The existence of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is not linked to the fall of the regime in Syria, as the party was founded before the existence of the regime itself, and the last four years before its fall were characterized by the severing of relations with our party, the punishment of its officials and the oppression of the nationalists in Syria. The regime also contributed to the division and fragmentation of our party's institutions. 

4- The party calls on the Syrian Social Nationalists in the Levant to work under the umbrella of Antoun Saadeh's approach and thought by consolidating the concept of community unity, preserving and maintaining public institutions, preventing any aggression against them, rejecting sectarian discourse, and cooperating with the forces that ensure the realization of the interests of the state and the people, and protecting citizens and property.

5- Calling on the Lebanese interior to spare all Lebanese the pitfalls of chaos whose features have begun to appear. We call for not betting on what they consider a loss for the national resistance project in order to avoid strife, which if it occurs, its fire will reach everyone.
The party demands that the Lebanese state and its military and security apparatuses prevent any attack or provocation sought by some hot-headed and irresponsible heads against any party office, and work to establish security and freedom of expression under the umbrella of the law and protect public and private property to preserve the unity of the country and ward off strife.

The Syrian Social Nationalist Party derives its spirit from its leader, Antoun Saadeh, and his teachings, and depends for its continuity on the vitality of the Social Nationalists and their struggle, jihad, political, and reformist project."

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-12-09T03:13:22+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇸🇾/🇮🇷 Some thoughts regarding Iran's future role in Syria & the future of the SAA:

Just like Turkey, Qatar and the US were supporting 'opposition' factions in Syria (like SNA, HTS and SDF), Iran will probably start funding / arming factions loyal to it inside Syria, after the new government is formed.

I give it a maximum of two years before we see the first tangible results of Iranian-backed 'opposition' groups inside the new 'Free Syria'. Iran will likely try to maintain at least some sort of influence in Syria this way.

Assad was never really in the 'Resistance Axis' camp, at least not in terms of ideology; he was loosely a part of it, mostly due to geopolitical considerations and strategic necessities. Fundamentally, he was not like Hezbollah, the PMF, or Ansarullah in Yemen, who are all revolutionary Shiites in ideology.

So, it is very possible that we will see an 'Islamic Resistance in Syria' within the next few months or years. They might not actually control territory inside Syria, but they could exercise soft power and carry out qualitative resistance operations against Israel or US bases, or even against the government itself.

Also, I would not discount the presence of some former pro-SAA / pro-Assad loyalists inside Syria. People like General Suhail Hassan, commander of the 25th SMF Division (Tiger Forces) enjoy considerable popularity inside Syria, especially among Alawites and upper-class Sunnis in the major cities.

In any future civil war, I expect some of the 'old guard' of the SAA High Command to gather portions of their old units and attempt at least a limited power grab, perhaps in Latakia and Tartous, or even in Damascus. These are areas that were much more pro-Assad compared to other areas in Syria. 

I'm not saying they'll actually be successful in overthrowing the future Rebel-led 'Free Syrian' Government, but Arab states like Syria are often quite susceptible to military rule. These states simply are not used to democracy, and military 'strongmen' from the former regime often end up in power.

Look at Egypt, where the regime was overthrown by Islamists in 2011, but the military (led by General Abdel Fattah el-Sisi) regained power only two years later in 2013. Or for example, look at the Libyan National Army (LNA) led by General Haftar, a former officer in the military of Muammar Gadaffi.

Even if this doesn't end up happening, you can be sure that former SAA elements will play a significant role in Syrian politics for years to come. Most of them will publicly disavow Bashar al-Assad though, as they don't want to be identified with him anymore. 

Maher al-Assad, Bashar's brother, is however sometimes said to have a promising political future. He's much more pro-Iran than his brother Bashar, and many consider him 'Iran's man' in Syria. Whether he's even still in Syria, and whether he will ever get involved in his country's politics again, remains to be seen. 

Lastly, HTS (or whatever the 'Free Syrian' Government will be) needs to prove itself. It has to show the population that it can not only control the institutions and the day-to-day life in Syria, but that it can defend the country from external threats. If HTS fails to show that it can effectively rule and govern a unified and strong Syria, especially in the face of ongoing Israeli aggression, then they could easily lose legitimacy quite soon, which would ultimately have consequences as it would bring considerable challenges to their rule.

In any case, the Islamic Republic of Iran will do whatever it can to maintain at least some sort of influence in Syria. Whether that's supporting pro-Iranian factions / Shiite militias, or supporting former SAA loyalists, Iran's arm is long, and it won't disappear.

It's mostly IRGC advisors that help supervise SAA units, their maintenance, logistics, etc., in addition to some lightly armed Afghan Fatemiyoun units, which are basically skirmishers, troops you deploy to defend a trench or operate a machine gun pit, or to rush lightly defended ('soft') enemy lines.

In some very dire circumstances, like in 2015 and 2016, Iranian special forces and some highly motivated & well-armed Basij units were deployed to secure specific high value targets and to achieve certain tactical objectives. 

But their numbers and their usage was limited, and 90% of their operations took place against ISIS (with the exception of some engagements in Aleppo) and in the countryside against irregular Daesh 'infantry', not conventional warfare with armored formations against the HTS / SNA in a highly urban and high-speed environment.

Some IRGC elements indeed left through Al-Bukamal crossing into Iraq while it was being handed over by the SAA to the SDF, mostly for practical reasons, as the road to Palmyra would have been much longer, and because the advisors supervised the crossing, which is now no longer under SAA control.

Almost all of the IRGC advisors, Afghan Fatemiyoun, and other Shia militias are currently in Damascus, especially in the Sayyida Zainab area near the shrine of Lady Zainab, after having relocated from western Aleppo. Also some presence near the Presidential palace and the Iranian Embassy.

Some high-ranking Iranian advisors, although very few, still remain inside Homs, in an effort to help organize the city's defensive lines in anticipation of the upcoming HTS offensive.

An important Iranian analyst on X, who has ties with Iranian personnel inside Syria, claims that Russia has assessed the situation, and it believes that an HTS takeover would not necessarily endanger their interests in Syria because they perceive HTS as 'anti-American'. Apparently, Iran has also assessed the situation, but came to the opposite conclusion, which has led to a rift between the two countries on the matter of Syria.

He also says Bashar al-Assad is much more receptive to Russian influence than Iranian influence, and that the Russians are currently involved in intense negotiations with him, while Iran is encouraging him to stand and fight, even offering to send forces.

The analyst also claims that Iran is slightly annoyed with Syria, because Assad allegedly refused to open up the Golan front against Israel, and I quote: 'Assad has been less and less willing to spend money or attention on the Axis of Resistance, he became less cooperative, prioritizing Syria's own interests first, being enticed by economic proposals from the UAE and other Gulf States.'

2024-12-05T02:39:06+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇸🇾 Many people have asked for my opinion about Syria, so here's my take:

I don't necessarily love Assad, mostly due to him being a secular. However, I don't really dislike him either, because I don't believe in all the Western-backed propaganda about him. He's also quite socially conservative despite being a secular, which I respect, and he is a supporter of the Palestinian cause and the Resistance Axis, which is a major plus.

Regarding the rest, I'll keep this very simple:

Syria's stability is necessary for the security of the region. It is also necessary for the continued flow of Iranian weapons to Hezbollah. If Hezbollah is weakened, Israel's focus will shift to Iran, and the entire Resistance Axis will be at risk.

Additionally, Syria also currently poses a strategic threat to Israel, because Assad is openly hostile towards it. It acts as a sort of 'buffer zone' between Israel and other regional nations. It's the first line of defense.

If the current Syrian government collapses, there will be major internal chaos and struggles between the various opposition groups, to an extent never seen before, which will jeopardize one of the most strategically and geopolitically important countries in the Middle East. Syria will be extremely unstable, and it will be a breeding ground for terrorism, even more than in 2014/15. There would probably be a resurgence of ISIS, or worse.

In the unlikely event that one of the warring opposition factions does eventually win and establish a nationwide government, it will likely be more pro-West, more liberal, and by extension more friendly towards Israel. This 'new Syria' would likely not freely allow the flow of Iranian arms into Lebanon, nor would it act as a buffer zone against Israel. And if we get unlucky, it will be openly pro-West and it might even establish relations with Israel. A major new enemy will exist in our region.

Long story short, we need a strong and stable Syria, and as of now, Assad is our only real option. That is why I will always support the SAA. Besides, Syria was one of the only countries to help Iran during the war against Iraq, and we do not forget old friends.

However, his presence and public image was so secretive, that Israeli intelligence estimated that no person called 'Javad Ghaffari' actually existed, and that he was made up by Iran as a diversion. 

This was until recently, when his image became slightly more public and his role as the IRGC's overall commander in Syria became a known fact. He carries the nickname 'butcher of ISIS'.

However, HTS did not stop advancing, and reached these defensive lines much sooner than expected, when the SAA had not finished regrouping or positioning itself, and they were in total disarray. So once again, they decided to withdraw to a defensive line further in the rear, which was Aleppo itself.

Instead of stopping and preparing for the assault on Aleppo, which is what the SAA expected, HTS just kept advancing, and every single time HTS was nearing the SAA positions, the defenders were not ready and had not properly established themselves yet. 

This led to a perpetual scenario where the SAA withdraws to deeper defensive lines, but the HTS simply catches up with them, and they once again retreat. Now, the command structure and communications have collapsed, and every division / brigade seems to be making its own decisions.

The only actual resistance we saw from the SAA was in Anadan and Western Aleppo Countryside during the first two days, and in Tadif, South of Al-Bab, because those positions were already dug in and somewhat prepared for defense. The HTS advance is simply so fast, that the SAA is in total chaos and cannot make a proper plan.

2024-11-27T19:41:43+00:00,-1001626824086,"— ❗️🇱🇧 Statement by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon (summarized):

– In support of the noble Palestinian people, the Islamic Resistance has completed its path, and continued its covenant of Jihad for more than 13 months at the orders of S.G. Nasrallah and S.G. Naim Qassem, achieving victory over the delusional Zionist enemy.

– Since October 8th 2023, Hezbollah carried out 4637 operations against Israel, and since September 17th 2024, it carried out 1666 operations against Israel with various weapons against various targets, including 105 operations against valuable strategic and sensitive targets in the 'Khaybar' operations series.

– Since the ground invasion, more than 130 Israeli soldiers were killed, 1250 were wounded, 59 tanks were destroyed, as well as several vehicles and drones. All of these losses are inside Lebanese territory, and do not include losses in the occupied territories.

– During the first phase of the ground operation, the Israeli Army did not succeed in establishing operational control over any of the Lebanese towns in the first line of defense, nor did they succeed in establishing a buffer zone, nor did they manage to thwart the launch of missiles and drones into Israel.

– During the second phase of the ground operation, the Israeli enemy was unable to advance into any of the Lebanese towns in the second line of defense, withdrawing three times from Khiyam, and from Ainatha, Taloussa, Bint Jbeil and Al-Qawzah. They only managed to advance towards Al-Bayada and Shamaa in the Western Sector, which became a graveyard for their tanks and soldiers, before withdrawing from there too.

– Hezbollah's defense plan is based on a large structure, and the resistance has prepared more than 300 different defense lines South of the Litani, each of which remain at the highest level of readiness in terms of manpower, equipment, and capability.

– The Islamic Resistance confirms that it will continue to monitor the movements of the Israeli enemy, and remains fully prepared to deal with any aggression, and our hands remain on the trigger.

The Islamic Resistance, which has offered its best leaders and mujahideen for the sake of Allah and in defense of its land and people, and on the path of supporting the oppressed in Palestine, today addresses you, and all the free people in the world, and the mujahideen in all the arenas, with a salute of arms, jihad, martyrdom and victory, and pledges in the name of its mujahideen and heros, all the pure blood and pure souls, to complete the path of resistance with even greater determination, and to continue standing by the oppressed, the weak and the mujahideen in Palestine with its capital, the noble Jerusalem, which will remain a symbol and a path for generations dreaming of freedom and liberation.'

The only real attempt to advance was towards the towns of Al-Bayada and Shamaa in the western sector, which became a graveyard for their tanks and elite soldiers, who withdrew from it under the blows of the Mujahideen.

– The defense plan of the Resistance is based on the Buqai defense system, and the Resistance has prepared more than 300 different defense lines South of the Litani River, each of which was at the highest level of readiness in terms of manpower numbers, equipment, and capabilities, and what happened in Al-Bayada and Al-Khiyam is the best evidence of this.

– The Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance confirms that its Mujahideen from various military specialties will remain fully prepared to deal with the ambitions and attacks of the Israeli enemy, and that their eyes will continue to monitor the movements and withdrawals of the enemy forces beyond the borders of Lebanon, and their fingers will remain on the trigger, in defense of Lebanon's sovereignty and for the sake of the dignity and honor of our people.

2024-11-27T19:25:15+00:00,-1001626824086,"— ❗️🇱🇧 Statement by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon:

'In support of the steadfast Palestinian people, and in support of their valiant and honorable resistance, and in defense of our steadfast Lebanese people, the Islamic Resistance has completed its path, fulfilling the order of its Secretary-General and Supreme Martyr, His Eminence, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, peace be upon his soul, and the banner-bearer after him, His Eminence Secretary-General Sheikh Naim Qassem, may God protect him. 

And Hezbollah has continued its covenant and jihad for more than 13 months, and has been able to achieve victory over the delusional enemy who could not undermine its resolve or break its will, and it was the field whose pure, Mujahideen men, who trust in God Almighty, were able to hinder the Israeli goals, defeat its army, and wrote with their blood their steadfastness and perseverance in the Al-Aqsa Flood Battle and the Battle of the Fierce.

On this glorious occasion, the resistance announces the following:

– The number of operations of the Islamic Resistance since the launch of the Al-Aqsa Flood operations on 08-10-2023 has reached more than 4637 military operations over 417 days, at an average rate of 11 operations per day.

– Among these operations were 1666 operations since the start of the Israeli aggression on Lebanon and the launch of the 'Battle of the Fierce' operations on 17-09-2024, at an average rate of 23 operations per day. These operations targeted the sites, barracks and bases of the Israeli enemy army, and the Israeli cities and settlements starting from the Lebanese border all the way to beyond Tel Aviv, and it also included heroic confrontation against the enemy forces' ground incursions inside Lebanese territory.

– Within the framework of the 'Battle of the Fierce' operations, the Islamic Resistance carried out 105 military operations that were part of the 'Khaybar' series of qualitative operations, through which it targeted dozens of strategic and sensitive military and security sites, which were targeted for the first time in the history of the Zionist entity, using qualitative ballistic and precision missiles and suicide drones, which reached beyond Tel Aviv, up to 150 km deep inside the occupied Palestinian territories.

The cumulative toll of losses incurred by the Israeli enemy army since the start of the ground invasion in Lebanese territory on 01-10-2024 until the date of issuing this statement is:

– More than 130 soldiers and officers killed and more than 1250 wounded.

– 59 Merkava tanks destroyed, 11 military bulldozers, 2 Hummer vehicles, 2 armored vehicles, and 2 personnel carriers.

- 6 'Hermes-450' drones shot down, 2 'Hermes-900' drones, and a quadcopter.

It should be noted that this toll does not include the losses of the enemy in its military bases, sites, barracks, settlements, and occupied cities inside Israel.

The Islamic Resistance Operations Room confirms the following:

– Throughout the Israeli army's ground operation inside Lebanese territory since 01-10-2024, and due to the steadfastness of our Mujahideen on the battlefield, the attempts of the enemy forces to occupy and establish themselves in any of the towns of the first line of the front did not succeed – noting that these towns were exposed to attacks since the beginning of 'Al-Aqsa Flood' – nor did they succeed in establishing a military and security buffer zone as the enemy had hoped, nor were they able to thwart the launching of missiles and drones on the occupied interior; and until the last day of the aggression, our Mujahideen continued to target the enemy's depth from within the border towns.

– The second phase of the ground operation was nothing but a political and media stunt, as the enemy was unable to advance to the towns of the second line defense, and suffered heavy losses in Khiyam, from which it withdrew three times, and Ainatha, Taloussa, Bint Jbeil and Al-Qawzah."

'We salute the great resilience of Hezbollah and the dear Lebanese people in confronting the brutal Israeli aggression. Through this steadfastness and the unity of the people, army, and resistance, Lebanon has achieved another victory by repelling this aggression and thwarting its malicious goals.  

The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, with its immense sacrifices, has only grown deeper in its roots, stronger, and more steadfast. It has excelled in its escalating operations, both in quantity and quality, forcing the Zionist enemy and its American sponsor to agree to a ceasefire that preserves Lebanon’s security, sovereignty, and independence.  

We have full confidence in the choices of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon. We believe its wise leadership has managed to regain the initiative in a short time despite the significant wounds inflicted upon the resistance, especially after the assassination of the esteemed Secretary-General, the martyr of Islam and Muslims, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah — may Allah's blessings be upon him. The Israeli enemy would not have relented and accepted a ceasefire were it not for its confrontation with a resilient resistance that stood firm against treacherous assassination crimes. This resistance rose with even greater ferocity, proving its ability to engage in a prolonged war of attrition — something a fragile and weak entity like the Zionist regime cannot endure. As described by the martyred leader His Eminence Sayyed Nasrallah, this entity is more fragile than a spider’s web.  

The martyrs of Hezbollah are martyrs on the path to Al-Quds. Hezbollah has performed admirably on this challenging path, continuing its support for Gaza and Palestine despite the shameful and disgraceful Arab and Islamic betrayal, with rare exceptions.  

The struggle against the Zionist enemy is inevitable, and the wars with it are rounds in a conflict that will inevitably end with its demise, God willing.'

We value the steadfastness of the Lebanese people and their ongoing solidarity with the Palestinian people in facing the zionist occupation and its brutal aggression. We ask Allah to safeguard Lebanon and its people from all harm.

The enemy’s acceptance of the agreement with Lebanon without achieving the conditions it had set represents a significant milestone in shattering Netanyahu’s illusions of reshaping the Middle East by force and his delusions of defeating the forces of resistance or disarming them.

We affirm that this agreement would not have been possible without the steadfastness of the resistance and the popular cradle that surrounds it. We are confident in the continued support of the Axis of Resistance for our people and their struggle through all possible means.

As we in Hamas closely follow the developments of this agreement in Lebanon, we express our commitment to cooperating with any efforts to establish a ceasefire in Gaza. We are keen to end the aggression against our people within the framework of the national terms agreed upon, which include a ceasefire, the withdrawal of occupation forces, the return of displaced persons, and the realization of a genuine and comprehensive prisoner exchange deal.'

It was Netanyahu and Biden that announced the ceasefire. Hezbollah stayed silent. Even now, Hezbollah has not made a statement.

This shows it was Netanyahu and Biden that had to explain and justify this agreement to their people, because this ceasefire is a total failure for them. In fact, it is an implicit capitulation to Hezbollah.

Netanyahu made it clear that 'Israel has accepted' the ceasefire, meaning it was Hezbollah which offered it. When you offer something, you are in the position of power, you dictate the rules and the conditions, you are the one who gets to make the demands. Israel was the one that needed this most.

Have you ever seen the winner of a war announce the ceasefire first? No, it's always the loser, because they need to justify it to their people, in order not to face backlash.

This ceasefire agreement, in many ways, is much more lenient and less strict than the 2006 agreement, which is unanimously seen as a victory for Hezbollah. So, I think it is clear where we stand. The Party of God is, once again, victorious on the battlefield.

Channel owners are human, they have emotions, they make mistakes, they are not infallible. However, that does not mean channel X or channel Y is a 'Mossad agent' or deserving of being equated to the Israelis.

The trend of some resistance supporters calling out pro-Resistance channels is concerning. Even if some of those channels or accounts deserve a fair amount of criticism, they certainly do not need to be dehumanized to such an extent. 

Preferably, advise them in private, try to talk with them about their mistakes, tell them what to improve, but don't publically disavow them. Sowing internal chaos inside your own camp is the dumbest thing you can do, it makes us seem dumb and divided, and it actually helps the enemy.

It is better to direct your complaints and anger towards actual Zionist media outlets, rather than towards Resistance media for making a simple mistake, even if the mistake is large. Because in the grand scheme of things, they still support and promote our narrative, the narrative of truth. And most of them have sincere intentions."

@Middle_East_Spectator"

Yes, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah has repeatedly stated this. However, back then, Lebanon was a 'support front' for Gaza, its purpose was to distract and drag away as much Israeli attention from Gaza as possible. Since then, Lebanon has become the main front of the war, the situation is simply not the same. 

Back then, Hezbollah was a shield for Gaza. Now, it has become more than a shield for Gaza, it has become a shield for Lebanon and its entire population. The decisions that will be made now are based on a totally different situation and a different operational reality than several months ago. 

Hamas is alive, it is fighting, and it will not surrender. The Israelis are unwilling to make any compromises, therefore, there will be no ceasefire in Gaza any time soon. Hezbollah knows this, and they are in constant communication with their brothers in Hamas.

Seperating the two fronts does not mean that one has abandoned the other. For example, if Hamas suddenly signed a ceasefire with Israel tomorrow without including a ceasefire in Lebanon, would anyone call Hamas traitors of Lebanon? No. Because this decision is only upto Hamas and the people of Gaza. And the same is true for Hezbollah.

Both organizations fight and support each other based on their own capacity and while simultaneously keeping responsibilities towards their own populations. I would like to remind you all, Hezbollah did not have to get involved after October 7th, this was done completely out of their own will, and for more than an entire year they fought against the Israelis PURELY to support Palestine and Gaza, no matter what sacrifices were made.

Hezbollah, like so many regional groups and Arab countries, could have simply chosen to sit silently and watch. But they didn't. They took action. And now, they are fighting this decisive battle on their own soil, because they enacted their humanitarian, Arab and Islamic duty to support Gaza on October 7th.

Any decision that Hezbollah will make is in coordination with the Lebanese state, and in coordination with Gaza and the various resistance factions, including Hamas. Trust their judgement, they know best.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-11-25T16:58:32+00:00,-1001626824086,"By the way, my personal opinion is that there won't be a permanent ceasefire anytime soon, maybe a temporary one at most, like what happened in Gaza."
2024-11-25T16:55:51+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇱🇱🇧 🇱🇧 TLDR: If there is a ceasefire based on UN Resolution 1701, Israel will fully withdraw from Lebanon, Hezbollah will remain in the South, and the situation returns to pre-October 7th of 2023.

This would mean that Israel was not able to achieve any of its two major objectives: 1. Depleting Hezbollah's missile power and defeating it militarily, 2. Forcing Hezbollah beyond the Litani River.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-11-25T16:50:12+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇱🇧 🇱🇧 There is optimism in Lebanon regarding a ceasefire based on UN Security Council Resolution 1701.

Contrary to what some anti-Lebanese media would have you believe, UNSCR 1701 would be a win for the resistance, as it would restore the 'status-quo' from before the war. This status-quo means that Hezbollah will remain active, it will remain armed, and it will remain deployed in all of southern Lebanon along the border, while Israel will be forced to retreat.

In practice, it will not force Hezbollah to withdraw beyond the Litani River, nor would it force Hezbollah to disarm or disband. Yes, technically the resolution states that the only 'armed forces' south of the Litani River should be Lebanese military and UNIFIL (meaning, not Hezbollah), but this will never be implemented because Israel does not implement part of its obligations.

For example, Israel is occupying the Shebaa Farms, which is internationally recognized as Lebanese territory, and resolution 1701 calls upon Israel to withdraw all its forces from Lebanon and for the Lebanese government to exercise full control of its territory. It is very simple: Israel will not adhere to this resolution, so neither will Hezbollah, and it has been like this for over 18 years.

Furthermore, the resolution calls on the disarmament of all 'armed groups' in Lebanon, but the Lebanese constitution does not consider Hezbollah an 'armed group', and the majority of the Lebanese political establishment considers Hezbollah to be exempt from this clause. This is very hard to change, especially with Hezbollah's ally in charge, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri.

People need to understand that UN Resolution 1701 was active in Lebanon before the October 7th war, it was the Status Quo. It is not something new, it is not an Israeli win, and Hezbollah will not disarm nor will it retreat a single inch.

It's very easy for me as a Shia to simply blame this violence on the Sunnis, but that would be wrong and close-minded.

Yes, a Sunni terrorist group started it by attacking an innocent convoy of Shias, but that does not mean Shias can enter a random Sunni village, burn it, and kill their inhabitants in return. Two wrongs don't make a right.

I am seeing far too many people simply siding with their own sect, Sunnis siding with the Sunnis, and Shias siding with the Shias, without accepting any nuance about the entire situation. 

It's either 'OMG, Shia Genocide happening in Parachinar!' or 'OMG, Iran-backed Shia groups are massacring Sunnis!'. There seems to be no critical thinking at all.

Sometimes, BOTH sides are wrong. Just because your sect does something, does not make it right, and it does not make your narrative infallible.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-11-23T17:32:56+00:00,-1001626824086,"Basically, Sunnis attacked a random Shia pilgrim caravan, killing dozens, and then yesterday night the Shias attacked random Sunnis inside Bagan in 'retaliation'.

Shias are calling this a 'Shia genocide' and blaming the Sunnis for what they call 'anti-Shia violence', while Sunnis claim that the Iranian-backed Zainabioon Brigade (which is not even active in Pakistan) is comitting massacres against Sunnis.

Truly, a shitshow from both sides."

A Lebanese organization calling itself ""Lebanon Is First"" appeared 10 days ago on Facebook, it has a Facebook page and its own website which was established on November 22, alongside spamming several ads on Facebook and YouTube, there is no presence of that group on the ground in Lebanon, again, it was only established on November 13, it describes itself as an NGO, and there is no known face behind it and no known members.

Their IP Addresses are described as ""Malicious"" when ran through security websites, as is described in the pics attached to it - the IP addresses also lead to the United States and not Lebanon, which also would benefit Israel, since the Lebanese government can not subpoena a company based in the United States, and so all of its details would be private

They also - are specifically recruiting Lebanese for ""Positive work"" and to ""Learn More""  urging those who are interested to leave their full name, addresses, and all personal information and a small description about themselves.

This is the same exact model where several precedents have shown, where Mossad recruited Lebanese citizens through online websites and non profit organizations

All materials purporting to the assets or members of such an organization are actually photoshopped and are not real.

The Arabic of the website and the organization also does not seem fluent or native, it seems to be translated and does not sound natural at all, as a matter of fact, it is Fusha, and no Lebanese Dialect Arabic is detected at all, and sometimes the Arabic is plain wrong and inaccurate.

The Facebook account is quite small - only 207 followers, with 204 likes, and almost all of their followers have AI generated content or are ""bot"" accounts.

This was brought to our attention by a Lebanese subscriber who noticed unusual advertisement patterns and plain mistakes for such an unknown website.

2024-11-22T14:46:05+00:00,-1001626824086,"⚡️🇰🇵🇵🇸 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of North Korea wrote a rather, interesting article published on 10th of October.

""A detestable criminal country that needs to be swept away in a day.""

Israel's genocidal campaign against Palestinians, which began in October last year, has continued year after year, and its means and methods have reached a point beyond human imagination, drawing the ire of the international community.

According to Palestine's Wafa news agency, Israel's rogue regime, which has no regard for international law and humanitarian principles, recently shocked the world by devising a “bill” to restrict the activities of the UNRWA, with the aim of massacring innocent Palestinians once again.

It is not enough that Israel has massacred more than 42,000 Palestinians and displaced more than 1.9 million Palestinians, more than 90% of the Palestinians in Gaza, in the past year since the outbreak of the Gaza crisis, but the Israeli criminal justice system's anti-humanitarian blockade of UNRWA, which is aimed at completely exterminating an entire people, is a heinous act of human rights abuses and a despicable war crime.

The murderers, who are ruthlessly depriving people of their human rights, the most important of which is the right to survival, and plotting to cut off the last link of the refugees, and the unscrupulous human white elephants, who are toasting and laughing at the spectacle of bombing the inhabited areas of Gaza, are grossly violating humanity's right to survival and development by expanding the scope of mass destruction to neighboring countries.

The international community is outraged that Israel, a dysfunctional country that ignores even the rudimentary notion of human rights and promotes extreme hateful ideas, and a country where criminals who take pleasure in human blood should never have existed on Earth in the first place.

All justice- and peace-oriented nations and progressive movements must unite to firmly defend human justice, conscience, and world peace by decisively stopping Israel's criminal atrocities and expelling this cancerous cancer of human society from the face of the earth"".

Therefore, North Korea declares Israel as an entity that must be swept away or destroyed, calls the Israeli government a government consisting of murderers, as a matter of fact, they imply satanic notions as they accuse the Israeli government of ""taking pleasure in human blood.""

They also, at the end, simply accuse Israel of being a cancer against humanity, and must be removed from the Earth.

Our fighters monitored the infiltration of an Israeli unit into a house on the western side of Tyre Harfa. We opened fire using medium-range machine guns, targeting the house directly, which damaged the structure and the enemy forces inside.

An enemy unit, supported by an armored vehicle, attempted to evacuate their casualties. The armored vehicle was targeted with direct fire, leading to its destruction. Our fighters continued combing the area. (Statement No. 17 issued at 7:00 PM yesterday).

– Israel assassinated our media spokesman, Mohammad Afif, in civilian clothes, in the middle of Beirut. After such actions, the response must come in the middle of Tel Aviv.

– Wherever the Israeli enemy advances, the Islamic Resistance confronts it, and we will expell them. 

– We estimated that the battle on Hezbollah's first line of defense would take 15 days, but due to the strength and determination of the fighters, it has now been almost two months.

– Hezbollah is not a regular army, its objective is not to stop the enemy's advance, but to cause as many casualties as possible, forcing gradual retreats.

– Any ceasefire negotiations must adhere to two demands: The total cessation of hostilities by Israel, and the preservation of Lebanese sovereignity. (Note: This would be a return to the Status Quo Ante Bellum.)

– During the ceasefire negotiations, we will continue to fight, and the fight will escalate based on the conditions on the battlefield, independent and seperate from the ongoing negotiations.

– Hezbollah is fighting side to side and shoulder to shoulder with the Amal movement, we are brothers in one nation.

– Hezbollah is prepared for a very long war, a war of attrition, and we can continue at the current pace for a long time.

3. Land Confrontations

– Western Sector:
The Israeli enemy forces proceeded to advance towards the town of 'Shamaa' with the aim of controlling it to reduce resistance rocket fire on the city of 'Nahariyya' and the occupied 'Haifa' area. The enemy forces infiltrated from the forests of 'Labouneh,' passing through the forests of the towns of 'Alma al-Shaab' and 'Tayr Harfa.' The advancing forces fell into ambushes set by our fighters.

During the infiltration of an armored company towards the vicinity of the town mosque and the municipality building (east of the UNIFIL site), our fighters targeted them with guided missiles, resulting in the destruction of two 'Merkava' tanks and a bulldozer. Our fighters also targeted an infantry force near the shrine of 'Prophet Shimon al-Safa,' causing a number of casualties.

Our fighters clashed at close range with the enemy forces around the shrine, the municipality building, and the mosque more than five times using machine guns, hand grenades, and rocket-propelled grenades, resulting in numerous injuries. Israeli ambulance forces called in helicopters to evacuate the injured and launched illumination devices to mark their location.

On the western outskirts of 'Al-Jbeen,' our fighters targeted a 'Merkava' tank with a guided missile, killing and wounding its crew. The operation area was also hit with 120mm and 81mm mortar shells, while the resistance missile force targeted the paths and positions of Israeli soldiers and vehicles on this axis with dozens of missile salvos and artillery shells.

– Central Sector:
In refutation of the Israeli narrative about the ambush at the 'Ainata-Maroun al-Ras-Aitaroun' triangle, the Islamic Resistance Operations Room announced that our fighters monitored a force from the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade infiltrating from the border area between 'Aitaroun' and 'Maroun al-Ras' towards the southeastern outskirts of 'Bint Jbeil.'

Despite intensive air campaigns, the force fell into an ambush. At 09:50 AM, our fighters opened fire, forcing the enemy to take shelter in a damaged house. Our Mujahideen targeted the house with anti-personnel and anti-armor shells, leading to the destruction of parts of the house on the force inside. Clashes continued for more than three hours, with the Israeli army admitting that an officer and five soldiers from the 51st Battalion were killed, along with four wounded.

– Eastern Sector:
The enemy intensified its aggression on the city of 'Khiyam' with more than 60 air and drone raids and over 130 artillery shells in preparation for re-advancing towards the city. Our fighters clashed with the advancing forces as soon as they arrived at the Wata al-Khayam area, using machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades. They targeted two 'Merkava' tanks with guided missiles, leading to their burning and causing casualties.

4. Enemy Losses:

Since the start of the 'second phase' of the ground operation in southern Lebanon on November 12, the total losses suffered by the Israeli army include more than 18 dead and 32 wounded (some critically), in addition to the destruction of 5 'Merkava' tanks and a military bulldozer. 

Cumulatively, since October 1, the losses include more than 110 killed and over 1,050 wounded, the destruction of 48 'Merkava' tanks, 9 military bulldozers, 2 'Humvee' vehicles, 2 [unnamed] armored vehicles, 2 APCs, 6 'Hermes-450' drones, 2 'Hermes-900' drones and a quadcopter.

2024-11-19T17:51:36+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🔴🇱🇧 Statement by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance regarding the field developments of the 'Uli al-Bas' (Battle of the Fierce) war, November 19, Part 1 of 2: 

1. Haifa Qualitative Operation:
The Haifa missile operation aligns with the Islamic Resistance Operations Room's promise to intensify the 'Khaybar' series of operations and refute enemy claims of destroying the resistance's missile force.

– The operation successfully reached five military bases, bringing more than 300,000 settlers into shelters. The settlers are paying the price for the spread of Israeli army bases inside settlements and occupied cities.

– The resistance is prepared to carry out similar operations in Haifa and beyond, even after Haifa, for a period that the enemy does not expect.

2. What Does the Enemy’s Announcement of the Start of the 'Second Phase' of the Ground Operation in Southern Lebanon Mean?

After the Israeli army’s air and ground operations in the border area declined by 40% due to its inability to establish itself inside Lebanese territory, the enemy announced the second phase of the ground operation in southern Lebanon.

– The Islamic Resistance confirms that the defensive operations during the 'first stage' forced enemy forces to withdraw beyond the border and deprived them of establishing themselves in most border towns.

– The Israeli air force continues to attack border villages it claims to control with daily air raids, artillery fire, and machine gun operations from border positions. 

– These attacks confirm the enemy's inability to establish itself inside Lebanon. Attempts to advance south of 'Khiyam,' which the enemy previously retreated from under fighters' strikes, further demonstrate the failure of the first stage.

– Since the start of the ground operation, our heroic fighters have carried out over 350 operations on Lebanese territory and more than 600 fire operations against Israeli military divisions in occupied territories, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy army.

– We assure the officers and soldiers of the Israeli army that what happened to the 51st Battalion of the Golani Brigade at the 'Ainata-Maroun al-Ras-Aitaroun' triangle is just the beginning. There are days, nights, and the battlefield between us and you. As our holy martyr said, 'You will enter vertically and exit horizontally.'

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-11-19T16:31:48+00:00,-1001626824086,"— By the way, Iran is still technically keeping its end of the agreement. The JCPOA stipulates that Iran has the right to increase its enriched uranium output if one (or more) of the parties, in this case the United States, fail to keep their obligations.

The United States never fully lifted their sanctions on Iran to begin with, even after the 2015 deal. Then in 2018, Trump unilaterally withdrew from the Nuclear Deal, so Iran increased its enriched uranium output, as per the agreement.

The fact that we are still sticking to the JCPOA is honestly ridiculous. Why should we have loyalty to such an agreement when the opposing parties could care less? There is no benefit for us. Just exit it already. And while you're at it, might as well exit the NPT.

Instead, in hopes of reviving the deal, President Pezeshkian is now agreeing to limit the output of 60% enriched uranium as a sign of 'good will' to the United States, EVEN THOUGH it is fully permitted per the JCPOA.

Mikati rejected the Iranian offer for fear of America's reaction. 

Larijani suggested that Iran send this aid by sea, but Mikati also refused. 

Larijani suggested that Iran send the money needed to meet these needs, but Mikati also rejected this proposal under the pretext of Western sanctions on Iran. 

In order not to embarrass Mikati, Larijani offered to send Iranian aid via Turkey and on Turkish planes.

Mikati also rejected this proposal. Mikati therefore preferred not to receive the aid coming from Iran to the displaced people so as not to anger America.

This suggests that the interceptor did not really 'malfunction' in the traditional sense, but was following some kind of very small projectile, following it even after it already detonated, therefore hitting the ground.

However, something interesting to note, is that it looks like there is a small preliminary explosion at the place of impact before the missile actually impacts.

This could mean that some sort of projectile already hit the ground, and then the Israeli interceptor projectile still went after it, impacting in the same spot where its 'target' was last active.

2024-11-13T05:09:29+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🔴 🇱🇧 Statement by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance regarding the field developments of the 'Uli al-Bas' (Battle of the Fierce) war, November 12: 

The fighters of the Islamic Resistance continue to confront Israeli aggression in Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy army in equipment and personnel along the front lines and deep inside occupied Palestine.

1. Land Confrontations:

– Western sector: Due to concentrated resistance strikes, Israeli forces withdrew from most advanced towns. The 146th Division remains stagnant in Labouneh forests and east of Naqoura. No infiltration attempts have been recorded since October 28, with the enemy conducting artillery and air strikes on towns like Tyre Harfa and Al-Batishiyeh. The resistance executed over 24 operations targeting Israeli positions in Maroun al-Ra'as and 26 operations on settlements, inflicting casualties. They ambushed infiltrating forces near Maroun al-Ra'as and Ainatha, resulting in enemy casualties.

– Eastern sector: Resistance strikes caused enemy forces to withdraw from Mays al-Jabal and surrounding towns. They targeted the 91st Division near Houla with precise missiles, causing significant damage. In Kfar Kila, attacks on Israeli bulldozers resulted in casualties among the engineering units.

2. Qualitative 'Khaybar' Operations: The Islamic Resistance has conducted 70 operations targeting 33 strategic sites up to 145 km south of Tel Aviv. The Air Force participated in 22 operations, launching over 60 drones.

3. Missile Force: The missile force has targeted enemy gatherings along the Lebanese-Palestinian border, exceeding 1,020 launches since September 17, with 125 in the past week. The first 'Fateh-110' missile was first used on November 6, striking the 'Tsrifin' base.

4. Air Force: The air force continues to target enemy sites, with over 315 operations and more than 1,000 drones launched since the Battle of Al-Aqsa Flood. Of these, more than 105 operations, during which more than 300 drones were launched, have occurred from September 17 until now.

— Total Enemy Losses: 

Since the ground maneuver began on October 1, Israeli losses include more than 100 dead and 1,000 wounded officers and soldiers, 43 destroyed Merkava tanks, 8 military bulldozers, 2 'Humvee' vehicles, 2 [unnamed] armored vehicles, and 2 APCs, 4 'Hermes-450' drones and 2 'Hermes-900' drones.

This tally does not include the Israeli enemy's losses in military bases, sites, barracks, settlements, and occupied cities.

5. The Islamic Resistance Operations Room confirms:

The Israeli army's move to the 'second phase' of the 'ground invasion' in southern Lebanon will result in more losses, while our fighters are prepared for a prolonged battle to defend our freedom and dignity. 

Despite claims of control over border villages, our fighters have launched rocket attacks from the Lebanese-Palestinian border and engaged the enemy behind their lines. The 'Khaybar' series of operations continues at a high pace, and the enemy's intelligence and air campaigns will not halt these operations, which cause confirmed casualties and force hundreds of thousands of settlers into shelters.

Huckabee is so pro-Israel that he even actively encourages establishing Jewish settlements in the West Bank, which are illegal under international law, and almost every U.S. administration has urged Israel to stop the expansion of such settlements.

He also denied the existence of Israel's military occupation of the West Bank: 'There is no such thing as a West Bank - it's Judea and Samaria. There's no such thing as a settlements. They're communities. They're neighborhoods. They're cities. There's no such thing as an occupation.'

It only happened in the streets and alleys, immediately after the game and the hours following it. When the Israelis entered their hotels, they did not get bothered. 

It should also be noted that this event took place mostly with the participation of Moroccan youths and other Muslim diaspora. Furthermore, it was not planned, but rather it was done spontaneously and sporadically.

However, Israel will want to twist this event, and try to make it huge, because they love playing the victim. They were seen as the victim since the end of WW2 in 1945, but that story stopped working at the end of 2023. 

They need something new they can call 'Jew hatred' so they will be victimized and obtain relevance again. That's the only reason Israeli media is covering this so much, and the Israeli government is freaking out.

The thought that Israelis are no longer safe inside Europe scares them like nothing elsehas ever scared them. They need to use the antisemitism card, they have no choice.

2024-11-06T21:29:40+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🔴 🇱🇧 Statement by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance regarding the field developments of the 'Uli al-Bas' (Battle of the Fierce) war:

The fighters of the Islamic Resistance continue to confront Israeli aggression in Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy army in equipment and personnel along the front lines and deep inside occupied Palestine.

1. Land Confrontations:
On October 28, Israeli forces began advancing toward the town of Khiyam with significant numbers and heavy air cover. They positioned themselves in Tal Nahas, Al-Hamams, and Al-Majidiyah Plain.

– The Islamic Resistance fighters executed a defensive fire plan, conducting over 70 targeting operations over three days, with 50 targeting the southern and eastern outskirts of Khiyam. They destroyed 4 tanks using guided missiles, targeting a position in 'Metula' that resulted in casualties. A security group in Tal al-Nahhas was also hit.

– One noteworthy operation involved a precision missile salvo targeting enemy soldiers and vehicles in Wadi al-Asafir, using missiles with 250 kg warheads, causing widespread panic and confusion among enemy ranks.

Additional operations targeted:
 
– Gatherings of forces in 'Metula' and surrounding orchards with 11 concentrated rocket salvos.
 
– A training camp and command headquarters in 'Ayelet HaShahar,' missile warehouses in 'Yesod HaMa'ala,' and an armored vehicle gathering grounds in Sha'al with 23 missile launches.

– On October 31, 2024, enemy forces were forced to withdraw, utilizing helicopters to evacuate the dead and wounded.

– During an Israeli attempt to advance towards Houla, a battalion-sized column of 40 vehicles was targeted with Kornet anti-tank missiles, destroying bulldozers and inflicting casualties. After retreating, the area was hit with more than 60 missiles in a series of salvos.

– Due to repeated resistance strikes, Israeli forces withdrew from several towns back across the border, with ongoing artillery and air operations in areas like Aita al-Shaab, Ramia, and Khiyam. Attempts to besiege Naqoura were met with missile counterattacks.

2. Qualitative 'Khaybar' Operations: Despite Israeli Air Force activity, the resistance intensified operations under the 'Khaybar' series, targeting strategic centers 145 km deep inside Israel using missiles and drones.

– Since launching on October 1, there have been 56 operations in the 'Khaybar' series, including 18 in the past week.

– More than 2 million settlers in an area exceeding 5,000 km² were forced into shelters, disrupting daily life with each operation.

3. Confirmation from the Islamic Resistance Operations Room: The 'Khaybar' operations are escalating effectively, with high management ensuring all goals are met.

– Settlements warned for evacuation are now military targets, housing command centers and artillery positions.

– The only achievement of the Israeli army in their ground maneuver has been the destruction of civilian infrastructure.

– Recent weeks have shown that resistance formations have organized effectively, leading to increased missile and drone attacks, reaching targets as far as Tel Aviv.

– Fighters on the southern border have successfully halted Israeli advances, preventing them from moving beyond the borders of frontline villages or approaching the course of the Litani River.

– Today marks the fortieth day since the martyrdom of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who united all segments of society in Hezbollah. He built a party that resists the enemy and strengthens national institutions, with a solid structure across various fields.

– The resistance of Hezbollah is characterized by strength, courage, and a firm belief in martyrdom.

– Sayyed Nasrallah received prestigious achievements as a leader of resistance; his legacy endures, and the resistance will grow.

– Netanyahu aims to eliminate Hezbollah, occupy Lebanon, and reshape the Middle East, unaware that he confronts a determined resistance.

– The occupation employs brutal tactics against civilians and relies on superior air power but fears directly engaging our fighters.

– Hezbollah has tens of thousands of fighters and will force the enemy to halt its aggression.

– We rely on the field; the occupation is a loser. Our strength lies in continuous resistance.

– Hezbollah does not depend on American elections, which are meaningless to us. Our focus is to prevent the occupation from achieving its goals; we will not bow to anyone but God.

– Netanyahu cannot win; negotiations will occur only after aggression ceases, with the Lebanese state and Speaker Nabih Berri mediating.

– Any negotiation must include stopping aggression and ensuring full protection of Lebanese sovereignty.

– I urge the Lebanese Army to protect maritime borders and clarify the reasons for the breach in Batroun. 

– A resistance led by the martyr Sayyed Nasrallah will achieve victory with heads held high.

– The era of defeats is over; we will win, even if it takes time. The enemy seeks a war of attrition, but we will stand firm, no matter how long it lasts, inflicting pain on the enemy.

'Kowsar' is a high-resolution imaging satellite, and 'Hudhud' is Iran's first communications satellite. Russia occasionally helps Iran launch its satellites into space, despite the fact that Iran also has its own space program, including SLVs and launch sites. Due to the weight of the satellites, a Russian carrier was needed, and the Soyuz rocket was chosen.

2024-11-04T11:59:16+00:00,-1001626824086,"🛑| 🖥 BREAKING: The Hanzala hackers, one of the largest & most well-known Iranian hacking group, announced that it has breached the computer systems of the Elad municipality (in Tel Aviv area). 

They succeeded in obtaining about 3TB of sensitive data, including residents’ personal documents, contracts, geographic information, and more. 

Additionally, the attackers reportedly deleted some information from the servers, disrupting municipal operations.

The Hanzala group is known for its activities against Israeli targets. In the past, it has carried out cyberattacks on government websites and private companies. Last April, simultaneously with Iran’s True Promise-1 strike, the group sent half a million text messages to Israeli settlers, urging them to oppose their government and support Iran.

2024-11-03T23:38:35+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 DEBUNKED: Western-funded media have recently invented a story, claiming that an Iranian woman in Tehran protested against the obligatory Hijab law by walking onto the streets in her underwear

In reality, the woman is a student of Tehran's Azad University, and according to her acquaintances and classmates, she was under immense stress, suffering from mental and psychological problems. 

She was taken off the streets by the police for disturbing the public order, and she was admitted to a psychiatric hospital to receive expert care. She was likely suffering from some sort of psychosis.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-11-03T22:04:53+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷/🇮🇱 ANALYSIS: In my opinion, I think that Iran will not attack Israel before the U.S. Presidential Election. The WSJ article also seems to confirm this.

While Iran dislikes Kamala Harris and Donald Trump equally, Harris is less likely to engage in a full-scale war against Iran, so Iran wants her to win. They don't want to take the risk of possibly influencing the election outcome by attacking Israel and delivering another major foreign policy failure to Kamala Harris, especially so close before Election Day.

I also think one of the reasons that Iran won't respond very fast is because the Israelis didn't respond fast either. And the Israelis didn't respond fast because Iran didn't respond fast after Ismael Haniyeh. In my opinion, Iran is doing this on purpose.    

By constantly waiting 1-2 months to retaliate, Iran is spreading the conflict over multiple months, across several seperate cycles of violence that are manageable and can be somewhat controlled. This allows Iran to repair, adapt and prepare for all scenarios between each new wave of exchanges. 

Iran is actively trying to control the pace of the escalation ladder, which is good. Israel's strength lies in short, powerful attacks that paralyze the enemy. If they are forced into a new cycle of exchanges every few months, this won't be in their favour at all. Israel is not very adaptable, and they are already under huge pressure, facing multiple different war fronts at once. Iran has time on its side.

2024-11-03T21:46:28+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 NOTE: When it comes to using 'heavier warheads' as the WSJ claims, Iran's most likely choice would be the Khorramshahr-4 hypergolic liquid-fueled MRBM

This missile, which was introduced in 2023, is the fourth generation of the Khorramshahr missile which was first revealed in 2017. Currently, it carries the largest known warhead in Iran's missile arsenal. The missile has not been used in battle before.

Besides its official name Khorramshahr-4, it is also called 'Khaybar', after a famous Jewish fortress that was conquered by the Muslims in the Arabian Peninsula during the advent of Islam.

The missile was specifically designed to reach Israel, and has a range of 2,000 km, with a warhead of 1,500 kg, and a Circular Error Probability (accuracy) of 10 meters.

But there were no mass-protests, no riots,  no civil unrest, because people trust the election process, and they accepted the will of the people.

In the United States, not only do supporters of the losing party often riot and create civil unrest, they also publicly claim nationwide election fraud or foreign interference. Last time, the sitting President even actively tried to overturn the election results. This is all besides the fact that there are only two real candidates in the US election, while Iran had more than half a dozen different candidates.

Yet somehow, international media have the audacity to call America a democracy, but Iran a 'dysfunctional dictatorship'.

Since October 4, the Israeli military has killed at least one child and injured 10 daily in Lebanon, according to UNICEF, but the real numbers are likely higher by the dozens. The World Health Organization reports at least 55 verified attacks on healthcare workers and facilities in Lebanon by Israel.

A recent CNN investigation analyzed over 240 airstrikes in Lebanon, revealing that at least 24 hospitals are within a 500-meter 'danger zone' designated by the Israeli military. Israel dropped munitions within a lethal range of 340 meters from at least 19 hospitals.

In Beirut and its southern suburbs, CNN confirmed that 10 hospitals fell within the 'kill zone,' where bomb fragments can cause fatalities. Nine hospitals have been damaged, three of which closed due to Israeli strikes since September 23. Lebanon's health ministry indicates that about 20% of hospitals in the country have been affected.

Israeli strikes have also killed at least 12 Lebanese Civil Defense first responders and 16 Lebanese Red Cross paramedics. Overall, since September 23, Israel has killed at least 111 emergency medical technicians, struck 107 ambulances, and damaged 34 hospitals.

2024-10-31T22:03:37+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🔴 🇱🇧 Full statement by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon, November 1: 

The Islamic Resistance continues to confront the Israeli aggression in Lebanon, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy in terms of equipment and personnel along various confrontation axes and deep into occupied Palestine.

1. Land Confrontations: 
In recent days, the Israeli army attempted to advance in southern Lebanese villages, facing resistance across multiple axes:

– First Axis: In the area of the 146th Division, Israeli forces attempted to infiltrate towards the southern neighborhoods of Sheheen and Al-Jbeen, as well as Wadi Hamoul. The Mujahideen confronted them, forcing a withdrawal and targeting enemy positions in Al-Dhuhayrah and Ras Al-Naqoura.

– Second Axis: In the area of the 36th Division, the Resistance targeted Israeli gatherings amidst attempts to penetrate Aita al-Shaab and Aitaroun.

– Third Axis: In the 91st Division area, after heavy losses during recent confrontations, the enemy maintained fire control but did not attempt further advances.

– Fourth Axis: In the area of the 98th Division, resistance fighters confronted an Israeli force advancing towards Kfar Kila, inflicting casualties and forcing evacuation by military helicopters.

– Fifth Axis: In the area of the 210th Division, the Resistance targeted attempts to advance near Kfar Shouba and Shebaa, effectively countering enemy movements.

2. Missile Force: The missile force has conducted 655 operations since September 17, 2024, including 63 in the last three days, targeting Israeli military sites up to 105 km into Israel, reaching the northern suburbs of Tel Aviv with various types of missiles, including precision guided ballistic missiles.

3. Air Force: The Air Force has conducted 76 operations with over 170 drones since September 17, 2024, striking deep into occupied Palestine, including 11 operations in the last three days, reaching up to 145 km deep into Israel.

4. Air Defense Unit: The Air Defense Unit has launched 20 surface-to-air missiles against Israeli aircraft, with 4 launches in the past three days.

— Total Enemy Losses: 

– Over 95 Israeli soldiers killed and 900 wounded.
– 42 'Merkava' tanks, 4 military bulldozers, 2 'Humvee' vehicles, an [unnamed] armored vehicle, and an armored personnel carrier destroyed.
– 3 'Hermes-450' drones and 2 'Hermes-900' drones shot down.

The Islamic Resistance asserts that enemy forces avoid visibility to prevent being targeted and rely on nighttime infiltrations. Supply lines remain intact, allowing for continuous resupply of weapons. Despite Israeli intelligence efforts, resistance fighters maintain the ability to launch rocket barrages from Lebanese territory without interruption.

2024-10-31T19:03:36+00:00,-1001626824086,"Like bro, Iran DIRECTLY struck Israel after the Damascus embassy attack, and after Ismael Haniyeh's assassination. Do they really think Iran will suddenly use its 'proxies'? 

This time, Iranian territory was attacked on a large scale, and 5 Iranians died, including 4 members of the army. The Israelis are either dumb, naive, desperate, or all three at once."
2024-10-31T18:53:51+00:00,-1001626824086,"— I highly doubt this:

1. First of all, Iran was attacked on Iranian territory by Israel itself, so the response will come from Iran, and it will be directly on Israeli territory. Iran even responded directly against Israel when Israel targeted the Iranian Embassy in Syria. Iran could have easily chosen to target Israeli assets abroad, but they decided to strike Israel itself, from Iran, with Iranian missiles. If they did it back then, when Iran was not even directly attacked, then they'll definitely do it now.

2. Second of all, it's not like Iran has missile bases or military bases inside Iraq. Saying that 'Iran will attack Israel from Iraqi territory' implies that it will be Iraqi militias doing it. This is not feasible, as the Islamic Resistance in Iraq does not have enough ballistic missiles and drones to launch a major attack against Israel simultaneously. They could launch probably a few dozen at once, but nothing more. And it will be easy to intercept. It would likely also instantly exhaust the majority of their current stockpile.

3. Third, it seems to me that the Israelis are publishing this in order to signal to Iran that this is a type of response they'll allow to go unpunished. Barak Ravid, the Israeli journalist who wrote the article, is basically telling Iran; 'attack us from Iraq, and we won't strike back', in the hopes that Iran will avoid a direct strike on Israel.

All in all, I think it's extremely unlikely for the response to come from Iraq. It's possible that the Iraqi Resistance is planning their own attack, but this would be seperate and independent from Iran's response.

2024-10-31T17:59:36+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Initially, many media and politicians inside Iran, mostly affiliated with the Reformists and the Pezeshkian government, tried to downplay the Israeli attack and urge for restraint.

Two days after the attack however, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei stated: 'The Israeli attack must neither be exaggerated nor downplayed. The military must decide on an appropriate response.' Since then, the narrative has completely shifted, and a strong response seems almost certain.

This echos a similar experience after the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in Tehran, when it was President Masoud Pezeshkian that wanted to avoid retaliation, but the Supreme Leader forced his hand, after the United States failed to abide by their promise of reaching a ceasefire in Gaza.

1. Try to infiltrate a Lebanese village.
2. Fail and retreat.
3. Airstrike the entire village.
4. Due to the airstrikes, Hezbollah does a tactical retreat to the second line of defense.
5. The village is now empty, and the IDF rigs it with explosives.
6. The IDF blows up the village, and leaves. 

Guess what? Hezbollah will return to these towns, even if they are turned to rubble, ashes and dust, because they are the people of the land, and this is their home. So will their families, and the thousands of civilians. 

Israel will never achieve its objectives, so they resort to these short-term 'solutions', which will be obsolete 1-2 years from now.

[Click to expand👇]
➡️On October 28, we spotted a German cargo ship called ""KATHRIN - Catherine"" docked at the port of Alexandria, Egypt, via the ""Marine Traffic"" program. 
According to the official website of the port of Alexandria, the ship entered the port to carry out military unloading operations, and is expected to leave the port on November 5. 
(2nd and 3rd pictures)

➡️It was scheduled to dock at the Namibian port of Walvis Bay on August 25.
But a day before its arrival, Namibia revoked its docking permit because the ship was carrying military cargo and explosives for Israel. (4th picture)

➡️The ship was forced to continue its course.
On August 29, the website ""Portugal Resident"" reported that the ship was sailing under the flag of the Portuguese islands of Madeira.
This angered the Portuguese opposition, which pressured the government to withdraw the flag from the ship. (5th picture)

➡️On September 19, the newspaper ""Publiko"" quoted the office of the Prime Minister of Slovenia and the Portuguese Foreign Minister indicating that the ship ""Katherine"" is heading to Montenegro and Slovenia. 
It explained that it will unload its cargo in the Slovenian port of ""Kober"", but without any clarification on how the shipment will then reach Israel. (6th image)

➡️Days after this statement, specifically on September 24, solidarity groups with Palestine in Montenegro called on their government to prevent the ship from docking in its ports.
Amnesty International also issued a report on October 1, calling on Slovenia, Montenegro and Portugal not to assist the ship in delivering explosives to Israel.
Indeed, the ship was unable to dock in Montenegro as a result of pressure campaigns.
(7th and 8th images)

➡️With further tracking, we found that the ship was on its way to Croatia on October 3, as a possible stop.
Then the boycott movement called on its supporters to take action and send a letter to Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Grlić Radman to prevent the ship from docking in the country.
The Croatian government responded to the pressure campaigns and banned the ship from docking in its ports.
(9th image)

➡️On October 7, Maltatoday reported that the Maltese Ministry of Transport had rejected all service requests from ships carrying weapons bound for Israel. 
Then, on October 10, the same website reported that Malta had refused to provide the ship with food and water while it was anchored outside its territorial waters.
(10th image)

➡️In response to pressure campaigns against the Portuguese government, the Catherine was forced on October 17 to officially abandon the Portuguese flag and sail under the German flag.

➡️After this difficult journey and boycott campaigns, the ship loaded with explosive materials to Israel docked at the port of Alexandria, announcing that it was its final stop and the site for unloading its cargo.

The United States had no influence in how Israel chose its targets in Iran, Benjamin Netanyahu has said. The prime minister said his country chose where to strike based on “national interests, not according to what American dictates”.

Netanyahu’s office issued the statement in response to a “completely false” local television report that Israel had avoided striking Iranian gas and oil facilities because of US pressure.

President Biden said that he hoped the unprecedented wave of Israeli airstrikes launched on Iran on Saturday would mark “the end” of escalation between the two foes. 

American officials claim they have for weeks been trying to convince Israel to limit their strikes to military installations, and said they categorised the attacks as a precise operation that avoided civilian areas.

Their role was downplayed by Netanyahu, who said his country chose its targets in Iran based on its “national interests and not according to American dictates”.

Iranian officials said they had “successfully” intercepted strikes on military sites in Tehran, Khuzestan, and Ilam, which had only caused “slight damage”.

However, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi left the door to escalation open saying “our determination to defend ourselves knows no limits”.

The Islamic Resistance continues to confront Israeli aggression in Lebanon, inflicting significant losses on the enemy. As of October 25, 2024, 48 operations have been recorded since the start of the Battle of the Flood of Al-Aqsa.

1. Land Confrontations: The Israeli army has attempted to advance into southern Lebanese villages, but the Islamic Resistance has effectively resisted these efforts: 

– First Axis (146th Division): Area: From Naqoura to Marouhin. The Resistance targeted enemy gatherings, resulting in heavy losses and a reduction in enemy forces.  

– Second Axis (36th Division): Area: From Ramya to Aitaroun. An ambush near Aita al-Shaab led to over 5 enemy fatalities and numerous injuries.  

– Third Axis (91st Division): Area: From Blida to Houla. A Merkava tank was destroyed by a guided missile, causing casualties.  

– Fourth Axis (98th Division): Area: From Markaba to Ghajar. Resistance fighters destroyed several enemy tanks and targeted gatherings in Houla and Markaba.  

– Fifth Axis (210th Division): Area: From Ghajar to Shebaa Farms. Multiple attempts to advance were met with rocket fire, deterring the enemy.

2. Missile Force: The missile force targets enemy gatherings in military sites along the Lebanese-Palestinian border and deep inside occupied Palestine, using various missiles, including precision types for the first time. Over the past four days, 103 launches reached a depth of 145 km, up to the southern suburbs of Tel Aviv.

3. Air Force: The air force has conducted 65 operations since September 17, 2024, totaling over 150 drone launches, including 30 in the past four days.

4. Air Defense Unit: From October 24 to 28, 2024, the Air Defense Unit launched 5 surface-to-air missiles at Israeli aircraft in southern Lebanon.

– Total Enemy Losses: 

Since the beginning of the enemy's 'ground maneuver in the south,' losses include over 90 dead and more than 750 wounded Israeli soldiers, along with the destruction of 38 Merkava tanks, 4 military bulldozers, a Humvee, an armored vehicle, and an armored personnel carrier, as well as the downing of 3 'Hermes 450' drones and one 'Hermes 900.' This tally does not include losses in military bases, sites, barracks, settlements, and occupied cities.

The view of the political and military leadership is also arriving at this conclusion. If we do not respond, we will set a bad precedent for the future, and the scope of Israel's attacks will gradually increase.

Iran now needs to take the reigns into its hand, and begin to take control of the escalation ladder and the pace of the battle.

2024-10-26T16:26:41+00:00,-1001626824086,"— ❗️🇮🇷 Full statement by the General Staff of the Armed Forces of Iran:

'To the noble and zealous nation of Islamic Iran: This morning, Zionist enemy jets, in an overt aggression and against international law, launched from Iraqi airspace about one hundred kilometers from the borders of Iran, a number of long-range airborne ballistic missiles with very light warheads, about one fifth of the warhead size of Iran's ballistic missiles, towards several border radars in the provinces of Ilam, Khuzestan and around Tehran province. Many of these radars were immediately restored, are some now in the process of being repaired.

In this illegitimate and illegal act, due to the readiness of the country's air defenses, a significant number of the missiles were tracked and intercepted, and enemy jets were prevented from entering the country's airspace.

The Islamic Republic of Iran, while reserving its legal and legitimate right to respond at the appropriate time, emphasizes the establishment of a lasting ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon to prevent the killing of the helpless and oppressed people.

The terrorist and criminal government of the United States, which plays a central role in supporting and encouraging the criminal actions of the Zionist regime in disrupting the security of the region, is warned to prevent the spread of conflict and instability in the region and the killing of innocent people, especially in Gaza and Lebanon.

We urge the United States to restrain itself and the illegitimate regime it supports (Israel) to avoid getting itself and its allies dragged into the endless quagmire that the Zionist regime has created.

The honorable people of Iran, the media, experts and analysts are requested not to pay attention to the rumors and unreliable enemy narratives and to follow the correct news through official sources and national media.'

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-10-26T15:41:02+00:00,-1001626824086,"— Not to disrespect my Sunni brothers, but it is Shias all across the Middle East that are taking up arms against Israel, even in Sunni-majority countries where the Shia population barely has a political foothold.

The only Sunnis that are currently fighting against Israel are Hamas, the PIJ and some other Palestinian factions, which is obvious and self-explanatory, because they are the ones being directly attacked in their country, so of course they will resist.

But there is Iran, there is Hezbollah in Lebanon, Ansarullah in Yemen, the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, the Islamic Resistance in Bahrain, and now the Islamic Resistance in Saudi Arabia. All of them are Shia. All of them are sacrificing themselves for Palestine, when they have nothing to do with it.

Is there not a single group of Sunni Muslims willing to sacrifice themselves? In Egypt for example, which has 100 million inhabitants and borders Gaza. Or what about Jordan? 

I can really only draw one conclusion: Resistance against oppression is a core concept within Shia Islam, but not within Sunni Islam. This theological & ideological difference, where Shiism emphasizes resistance and Sunnism emphasizes pacifism, is becoming clearer day by day. 

For some reason, only when it happens to aligns with US and Israeli interests (like in Syria), the Sunnis have no issue taking up arms against their government or waging a violent war.

Thankfully, more and more people are starting to see that the only way to defeat US-Israeli hegemony in the Middle East is Islamic Unity. Only if Shias and Sunnis work together, the Islamic World can become strong enough to thwart the enemy aggression once and for all.

I would estimate anywhere between 5 to 10 hits total, in a 'best case scenario' for Israel, although we only have visual confirmation of 1 or 2 hits currently, one near Tehran and one in Eslamshahr.

The explosions were very small so I doubt there was any major damage, probably some of them were caused by quadcopters.  

No critical targets were attacked, the military targets were very low value, like empty IRGC training grounds (firing ranges and parade grounds) and some warehouses as well as drone assembly points.

2024-10-24T17:52:35+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Statement by the Leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Khamenei, on the martyrdom of Hashem Safi Al-Din:

'In the name of God, the most Merciful, the most Benevolent:

Dear youth of the Resistance Front, His Excellency Sayyed Hashem Safi Al-Din, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, joined the ranks of the martyrs of the resistance and another bright star illuminated the sky of Jihad on the way to the Holiest of Holies. He was one of the most prominent personalities in Hezbollah and an unwavering friend and companion of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah. 

Hezbollah, with the tact and courage of leaders like him, was able to protect Lebanon from the danger of disintegration and to neutralize the threat of the usurping Zionist regime, whose brutal and cruel army is even attacking the capital Beirut. His bravery and sacrifice combined with the other commanders and the Mujahideen were the backbone of Nasrallah, who neutralized the Israeli threat of usurping and occupying Lebanon below the Litani River, Tyre and other cities in that region and its annexation to Israel. While preserving the territorial integrity of that country, he brought it to the field, and made the aggressor and criminal Zionist regime fail.

Today, leaders like Nasrallah and Safi Al-Din are no longer present in this epic, but their spirit and leadership is present in the field which defends Lebanon and its defenseless people. Even today, Hezbollah is the strongest protector of Lebanon and the only shield against the greed of the Zionist regime, which has long aimed at the division of Lebanon. The enemy tries to deny the selfless role that Hezbollah plays for Lebanon. Anyone who loves Lebanon should not let these false statements be heard from their throats.

Hezbollah is alive and growing, and is playing its historical role. As always, the Islamic Republic will help the Mujahideen of Al-Quds and those resisting the criminal occupying Zionist usurpers of Palestine, God willing.

I congratulate and offer my condolences on the martyrdom of our beloved Sayyed Hashem Safi Al-Din to his dear family, relatives and comrades in all the axes of resistance. And peace be upon the righteous servants of Allah.'

– Imam Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei

2024-10-24T13:00:26+00:00,-1001626824086,"Just as the IDF “uncovered” that employees of UNRWA were involved in October 7, only for the WSJ report (where the story first broke) to be proven unsubstantiated, the IDF has now accused the most prolific and well known journalists in Northern Gaza of being Hamas members, with some of the most outlandish job descriptions. 

The journalists maligned are Anas Al-Sharif, Alaa Salameh, Hossam Shbat, Ashraf Al-Sarraj, Ismail Abu Omar and Talal Al-Arrouqi.

The IDF claims that, along with being Journalists that report daily:

1. Sharif was the head of a rocket launching division and a part of Al-Qassam’s elite Nuseirat Battalion 

2. Salameh was the deputy head of a propaganda unit

3. Shbat was a sniper in the Beit Hanoun Battalion

4. Al-Sarraj was a member of PIJ’s Bureij Battalion

5. Abu Omar was training company commander in East Khan Younis

6. Al-Arrouqi was a team commander in the Hamas’ Nuseirat division.

While the accusations aimed at UNRWA were followed by Israeli  attacks on aid convoys and resulted in the West cutting off life saving aid, the IDF is using these unfounded accusations against the journalists, some of whom are in the besieged Jabalia, to not only prevent coverage of Israeli war crimes, but to also implicate Al-Jazeera as being the willing propaganda arm for Hamas. Such an accusation can be used as a pretense to further restrict Al-Jazeera’s operations in Gaza and the West Bank, just as Israel had done in both May and September of this year."

The Su-35/30 saga is a long ongoing drama within the Iranian OSINT sphere, and almost every month since 2021 it's reported that Iran either 'received' its first batch, 'is imminently going to receive' its first batch, or is in the 'final stages' of receiving its first batch of Su-35 fighter jets.

At this point, rest assured that no Iranian media knows when the Su-35 are going to arrive (if they even will). I'll believe it when I see them on an airstrip in Isfahan.

Same thing with S-400, it's all just rumors, no substance or any evidence so far, and it will continue being that way till we actually see them in service.

The Islamic Resistance is actively confronting Israeli aggression in Lebanon, inflicting significant losses on the Israeli army in both personnel and equipment along several fronts.

1. Ground Operations:
Recent attempts by the Israeli army to advance into southern Lebanese villages have been met with resistance across multiple axes:
 – First Axis: From Naqoura to Maroun al-Ras, where Islamic Resistance fighters thwarted infiltration attempts and targeted enemy gatherings.
 – Second Axis: In the Aita al-Shaab area, where the enemy faced heavy losses and attempts to occupy key heights were repelled.
 – Third Axis: From Blida to Houla, where the enemy attempted to advance while booby-trapping houses, encountering fierce resistance.
 – Fourth Axis: In the area of the 98th Division, where the infiltrating forces suffered significant casualties from resistance fighters.
 – Fifth Axis: From Ghajar to Shebaa, where the Israeli army seeks to secure its positions but faces heavy fire from the Islamic Resistance.

The Islamic Resistance confirms that the enemy has not fully occupied any village in southern Lebanon.

2. Missile Force:  
The missile force is increasingly targeting enemy military positions along the Lebanese-Palestinian border and deep within occupied Palestine with various missile types, including precision weapons.

3. Air Force:  
The air force is actively monitoring and targeting Israeli military bases, employing various drones, including new types.

4. Air Defense Force:  
Islamic Resistance air defense units have successfully engaged Israeli aircraft, shooting down four drones.

5. Enemy Losses:  
Losses include over 70 dead and more than 600 wounded Israeli soldiers, the destruction of 28 Merkava tanks, 4 military bulldozers, armored vehicles, and Hermes-450 and Hermes-900 UAVs.

This does not include the losses in military bases, sites and barracks in the north and depth of occupied Palestine (Israel) as a result of drone or missile attacks.

'We the nation of martyrs and mujahideen, the nation of resistance and victory, mourn a great leader and a great martyr on the road to Jerusalem, the Chairman of the Executive Council of Hezbollah, His Eminence, the scholar Sayyed Hashem Safi Al-Din, may God Almighty be pleased with him. 

It is he who traveled back to his Lord with the best of his Mujahideen brothers, content, satisfactory, patient and full of reward, during a criminal, Zionist raid of aggression.‏

Sayyed Hashem joined his brother, our highest and most precious martyr, His Eminence the Secretary-General of Hezbollah Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and he was the one who comforted his brother, and was to him like Abu Al-Fadl Al-Abbas, peace be upon him, was to his brother Imam Hussein, peace be upon him. He was his supporter, the bearer of his standard, the posessor of his trust, the one who relied on him in times of adversity, and his guarantor in times of difficulties. He left while supporting the religion of God, pious, righteous, pioneering, managing, directing, leading, and martyred.‏

His Eminence Sayyed Hashem Safi Al-Din gave most of his life in the service of Hezbollah and the Islamic Resistance and its community. Over the many years of his honorable life, he managed with responsibility and ability the Executive Council and its various institutions and units operating in various fields and everything related to the work of the resistance. He was close to its mujahideen, close to its masses, and loved by the families of its martyrs, until God endowed him with dignity as a martyr in the illustrious caravan of Karbala's martyrs. ‏

We extend our condolences from the Master of the Age and Time (Imam Mahdi), from His Eminence the Guardian of the Muslims, may God protect him, from the blessed seminaries throughout the Islamic world, from his Mujahideen brothers in the Islamic Resistance, and from his honorable and patient family. We ask God Almighty to grant them beautiful patience and the reward of this world and the hereafter.

We pledge to our great martyr and his brothers, the martyrs, to continue the path of resistance and jihad until the goals of freedom and victory are achieved.'

As the channel's audience has grown, our editorial policy has become more and more strict, allowing for less freedom of personal opinions and certain statements, due to the sensitive nature of the media field and the status of free speech in Europe and the United States, which is under immense strain.

I want you all to know that I'm proud of every single one of you, I have not forgotten any of you, those who used to share me (and still do), those who used to give me advice, and those who taught me harsh lessons or offered me comfort. 

Without your help, support, prayers, kindness and encouragement, we would not have been where we are today. You are all in my prayers.

To all those who feel that we may have our differences or disagreements: I humbly ask for your forgiveness, I ask God to guide both me and you, and to keep our intentions sincere. All I have ever wanted is to support this cause, however I am simply a human, and therefore I am imperfect. 

وَلَا تُصَعِّرْ خَدَّكَ لِلنَّاسِ وَلَا تَمْشِ فِى ٱلْأَرْضِ مَرَحًا ۖ إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يُحِبُّ كُلَّ مُخْتَالٍۢ فَخُورٍۢ 

'And do not turn your nose up to people, nor walk pridefully upon the earth. Surely Allah does not like those who act arrogant, boastful' (Quran 31:18) 

This verse acts as a powerful reminder to us all, first and foremost to myself. Your success is my success, and we would be nothing without your support.

I sincerely ask for your prayers, so that this path may continue, inshaAllah.

We also reiterate that we have no connection to the original source, which we assume to be a whistleblower within the U.S. Department of Defense.

As far as we are aware, the documents first appeared in a private Telegram group with just over 7000 members, where the leaker was likely present. Somehow, the documents found their way out of the group; it was at this moment that Middle East Spectator took notice of the documents through an anonymous DM. Such DMs were sent to various other people and news outlets.

Middle East Spectator is an open-source news aggregator. We are independent journalists, and are not tied to any government entity or organization.

On Friday morning at approximately 01:15 AM Tehran time, one of our acquaintances received, through an anonymous source on Telegram who refused to identify himself, two highly classified U.S. intelligence documents, regarding preparations by the Zionist regime for an attack on the Islamic Republic of Iran.

We have no connection to the original leaker, and we are not aware of his identity. We also have no knowledge of the alleged authenticity of the documents. 

Furthermore, we assumed that the documents had been floating around elsewhere on Telegram, making them a part of the public domain.

END STATEMENT"
2024-10-19T16:33:05+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇱 BREAKING: Israel's 'Walla News' writes about Middle East Spectator channel and the leak of classified U.S. documents:

'Senior American officials today expressed great concern over the leak of two American intelligence documents that dealt with Israeli preparations for an attack on Iran which were published by a Telegram account identified with Iran.

Why this is important:

The US Department of Defense and the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence declined to comment on the leaked documents but did not deny their authenticity.

The timing of the leak occurred as Israel was completing its preparations for retaliatory action in Iran, in response to the missile attack of October 1 and was seen as an attempt to influence or disrupt it.
An Israeli senior official said that the security establishment is aware of the leak and takes it very seriously.

The leak occurred on Friday when the Middle East Spectator Telegram channel claimed to have received documents from a source in the American intelligence community about Israeli preparations for an attack on Iran.

The Telegram channel in question mainly publishes pro-Iranian propaganda content, and the profile of the Twitter account operated by that Telegram channel explicitly states that its operators are located in Iran.

The documents included a report by the Visual Intelligence Agency of the US Department of Defense, which was distributed within the US intelligence community three days ago, and which details operations carried out in recent days at several bases of the Israeli Air Force, including the transfer of advanced weaponry which, according to the report, was intended for an attack on Iran.

The report also states that according to intelligence obtained through wiretapping, the Israeli Air Force conducted an exercise this week in which fighter jets and UAVs took part as a possible preparation for an attack on Iran.'

The French newspaper claims that Qalibaf said that Iran is ready to negotiate with France regarding the implementation of UNSC Resolution 1701 in Lebanon, which would see Hezbollah withdraw beyond the Litani river, Israel withdrawing from southern Lebanon and the Lebanese army obtaining exclusive control of the South.

After this alleged statement, Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati summoned the Iranian Chargé d'Affairs.

However, this quote by 'Le Figaro' is completely inaccurate: Qalibaf said that Iran is willing to support any ceasefire in Lebanon that is accepted by the Resistance (Hezbollah) and the Lebanese state.

According to the report, the U.S. has observed the Israeli Air Force handling ALBMs (air-launched ballistic missiles) like 'Golden Horizon' (at least 16) and 'ROCKS' (at least 40) at Hatserim airbase since October 8. If all of these are used, it would be a major attack.

From October 15 to October 16 the Israeli Air Force also handled several ASMs (air-to-surface missiles) at Ramot David and Ramon airbases, indicating an imminent attack.

2024-10-17T21:30:52+00:00,-1001626824086,"— ❗️🇱🇧 Full statement by the Operations Room of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon:

'The Islamic Resistance continues to confront the Israeli aggression on Lebanon, and the Israeli enemy army has suffered heavy losses in its equipment and personnel, including officers and soldiers, along the various confrontation axes at the frontline in southern Lebanon. Since the start of the ground operations at the frontline of the Lebanese-Palestinian (Israeli) border, the enemy has brought in 5 divisions comprising more than 70,000 officers and soldiers, in addition to hundreds of tanks and military vehicles. In contrast, several hundreds of Islamic Resistance fighters remain fully prepared and ready to confront any Israeli ground incursion towards the villages of southern Lebanon.

1. Ground operations:

The beginning of this week witnessed an escalation in the pace of the heroic confrontations waged by the Islamic Resistance fighters against the officers and soldiers of the Israeli enemy who penetrated from several routes in the Eastern and Western sectors towards the villages of Odaisseh, Rab Thalatheen, Blida, Markaba, Al-Qawzah, Ayta Al Shaab, and Ramyeh, with heavy fire support from the air force and artillery, targeting the aforementioned villages and their surroundings. 

According to pre-prepared field plans, the Islamic Resistance fighters confronted the enemy forces in the surroundings and inside various villages by targeting the paths of advance, and luring the enemy forces into advanced ambushes inside the border villages, where violent clashes took place with the enemy at point-blank distance, especially in the towns of Al-Qawzah and Rab Thalatheen, which resulted in the enemy suffering 10 dead and more than 150 wounded and the destruction of 9 Merkava tanks and 4 military bulldozers.

2. Missile Force:

The missile force of the Islamic Resistance continues, gradually increasing day by day, to target the gatherings of the Israeli enemy in military sites and barracks along the Lebanese-Palestinian (Israeli) border and in the settlements and occupied cities in the north, reaching its military bases deep inside occupied Palestine, with various types of missiles, including precision-guided missiles that are being used for the first time.

3. Air Force:

The Air Force of the Islamic Resistance continues, gradually increasing day after day, to target the enemy's military bases on the Lebanese-Palestinian (Israeli) border, reaching deep inside occupied Palestine, with various types of attack drones, including types that are being used for the first time. This is in addition to reconnaissance and information gathering missions.

4. Air Defense Force:

The fighters of the Islamic Resistance in the Air Defense Force have confronted and continue to confront the Israeli military aircraft that are attacking Lebanon, both reconnaissance and combat aircraft, with appropriate weapons, and they were able to shoot down two 'Hermes-450' reconnaissance UAVs.

5. Enemy losses

The enemy's losses, according to what the Islamic Resistance fighters monitored, amount to about 55 dead and more than 500 wounded from the officers and soldiers of the Israeli enemy army, in addition to the destruction of 20 Merkava tanks, the destruction of 4 military bulldozers, an armored vehicle and an armored personnel carrier, in addition to the downing of two 'Hermes-450' drones. This toll does not include the losses of the Israeli enemy in military bases and barracks along the border or inside occupied Palestine.

Transition towards escalation

Based on the directives of the resistance leadership, the Islamic Resistance Operations Room officially announces the transition to a new and escalating phase in the confrontation with the Israeli enemy, which will be discussed and witnessed in the events of the coming days.'

According to Israeli media, an IDF force spotted 5 Hamas fighters in Rafah while carrying out their 'duties'. Then, their tanks were ordered to open fire on these fighters.

All the fighters died, except one, who was Yahya Sinwar. So, the IDF fired a shoulder-launched explosive missile at the building with Sinwar, which also did not kill him.

After this, the IDF launched an FPV drone in Sinwar's direction, who stood up, gathered some stones and tried to hit the drone.

Then, eventually, after more than 15 minutes, it was an IDF sniper that shot Yahya Sinwar in the head while he was out of cover, engaging the drone. This explains the bullet wound seen in the images.

He fought until the very end.

Fighting for truth and justice against falsehood and oppression is one of our divine commands within Islam, taught to us by the Prophet ‎ﷺ and his pure Household عليهم السلام.

No matter the costs of this path, no matter the sacrifices, we continue. Not only is this a divine duty, it is also a humanitarian one. Imam Ali عليه السلام the son-in-law of the Prophet ‎ﷺ said: 'He whom is not your brother in faith, is at least your equal in humanity.'

Standing up for the oppressed is a noble and just cause, whether it is the people of Gaza, the people of Lebanon, the people of Syria, Kashmir, Sudan, Donbass or Artsakh, they all deserve a voice. 

We aim to be that voice, the voice of the voiceless, and thanks to God Almighty, with the help of thousands of like-minded people across the world, we as independent news outlets have managed to expose Israeli and American war crimes to the world. Our narrative is finally becoming mainstream. People are finally opening their eyes.

I truly believe this generation will be the one to make the change, the generation that will no longer accept injustice, degeneracy and perversion. The generation that will build our world as a new, better place. InshaAllah.

Iran has not, and will never, communicate or 'negotiate' with Israel, even indirectly, and this has been official policy for 45 years. The government does not recognize the Zionist entity as a legitimate state, therefore any direct or indirect contact with its 'officials' or 'representatives' is impossible. 

If Iran wants to send a message, they will do so by making public statements, and if necessary, by conveying information to Arab nations like Qatar and Oman who will pass it onto the United States, which will then probably inform Israel.

Besides, there is currently no need nor any benefit in negotiation: There is simply no 'option' or 'way out' if Israel strikes Iran. The Islamic Republic will strike back, and the response will be harsh and overwhelming.

Israel has killed at least 175 journalists, the highest toll recorded by the Committee to Protect Journalists since they began tracking deaths in 1992; by comparison, 56 journalists were killed in Iraq in 2006, the next deadliest year.

2024-10-13T12:24:05+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇺🇸 Our updated prediction of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: 

Donald J. Trump will become President of the United States with at least 306 electoral votes.

Compared to our last forecast, Trump now picks up the states of Georgia and Michigan, winning all battleground states except Nevada, bringing his electoral votes to 306.

Georgia is a fundamentally red state, having voted Republican in nearly all of the recent elections except 2020 by a narrow margin. While we believe VP Kamala Harris initially had a shot at taking Georgia due to her support among Black voters, the lack of President Biden's response to hurricane Helene and Trump's increasing popularity among black voters has tilted the state towards Former President Donald Trump.  

Michigan is usually considered part of the 'Blue Wall' which Biden managed to hold in 2020 along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. These three swing states have been very competitive and influential in the last two election cycles, deciding the outcome of both past elections. 

Biden won the state very narrowly, and Kamala Harris will likely lose it by a slim margin, because she doesn't have as much support among White blue collar voters as Biden did in 2020. She also doesn't have the support of several major labor unions, unlike Biden did. Additionally, many Muslim voters in Michigan are not planning to vote Democrat, due to the genocide in Gaza. Jill Stein, a third party candidate, will skim some Democrat voters away from Harris. On top of that, Trump appeals way more to White, working class voters in Michigan, and his state-wide rural support will probably be enough to defeat Harris, who will gain votes mostly in large cities such as Detroit.

– The Israeli Air Force launched dozens of airstrikes together with violent artillery from land and sea in the Western sector.

– On Tuesday, the IDF tried to advance towards the UNIFIL base in Labbouneh, but they were forced to retreat.

– On Wesnesday, the IDF tried to advance towards Labbouneh three more times, but was forced to retreat each time, after taking heavy casualties.

– Hezbollah monitored an infiltration attempt towards Al-Mushairfeh, and struck the infiltrating force with an explosive drone, killing and wounding many Israeli soldiers.

– On Thursday, an Israeli force accompanied and protected by a Merkava tank attempted to advance towards Labbouneh, but Hezbollah destroyed the tank with an ATGM as soon as it entered the range of fire, killing its crew and injuring the accompanying infantry.

– Four seperate times, during a span of multiple hours, the IDF failed to evacuate its casualties from Labbouneh due to Hezbollah mounting repeated attacks against them.

– Hezbollah's fire support groups continue to target Israeli gatherings, positions and supply lines along the entire front.

– The missile and drone force continue to target military bases and cities inside Israel.

– There is complete and instant communication between Hezbollah's leadership and the operations room which oversees the battles on the front.

– After more than a week, the IDF still cannot expose its tanks inside Lebanon, due to continued targeting, so it positions them in concealed places only.

– The Israeli enemy, until now, has not managed to control any of the strategic hills it is trying to capture.

– Israel has only captured some houses on the outskirts of border villages and is taking some photos for the media.

– We warn all Israelis to stay away from military positions and military gathering sites in cities and settlements across the North.

– Hezbollah will not agree to a ceasefire, and will not allow Israeli settlers to return to the occupied North, unless Israel agrees to a permanent ceasefire in Gaza.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-10-11T20:35:53+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇱🇧 Statement issued by Hezbollah's Operations Room (part 1):

– After the resounding failures and heroic resistance that the Israeli enemy army faced in the Eastern Sector, it has been trying in the past two days to advance in the Western Sector from the direction of Ras al-Naqoura and Jal al-Alam towards Mushairfeh and Labbouneh, trying to take advantage of the terrain that Israeli believes is more in its favour.

– Before attempting to advance on the new axes, the Israeli Air Force launched dozens of airstrikes together with violent artillery shelling from land and sea on the towns of al-Dhuhayrah, Alma al-Shaab, and al-Naqoura.

– At dawn on Tuesday, a force from the Israeli enemy attempted to advance from Ras al-Naqoura towards the border area of ​​Labbouneh with the aim of reaching the UNIFIL forces base in Labbouneh and positioning themselves there, but the fighters of the Islamic Resistance confronted them with appropriate weapons and forced them to retreat.

– On Wednesday, the Israeli enemy resumed its advance towards Labbouneh through three repeated attempts, but the Mujahideen confronted it in each attempt with rockets, artillery, and guided anti/tank missiles, forcing it to retreat, inflicting heavy losses among its soldiers.

– On Wednesday, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance monitored an infiltration attempt by an Israeli enemy force from Ras al-Naqoura towards the al-Mushairfeh area, so they targeted it with a suicide drone that exploded among the infiltrating force, killing and wounding most of its members.

– On Thursday, a group of Israeli soldiers, accompanied and protected by a Merkava tank, attempted to advance towards the Labbouneh area from Ras al-Naqoura, and as soon as the tank was within range of fire, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance targeted it with a guided anti-tank missile that hit it directly, resulting in its destruction, ignition, the killing of its crew and the injury of the soldiers taking cover behind it. 

– The enemy failed in four seperate attempts, over a period of hours, to advance to withdraw the casualties, as the Mujahideen confronted it each time with appropriate weapons and forced it to withdraw time after time.

– Hezbollah's fire support groups continue to target the gatherings, positions and logistical lines of the Israeli army in the military sites and barracks along the entire frontline and inside the border settlements.

– The missile force and drone force of the Islamic Resistance also continue to target military bases and settlements deep inside the occupied North, gradually increasing day by day.

– There is a complete and instant coordination between the leadership of the Islamic Resistance and the operations room, reaching the brothers stationed on the front lines.

– More than a week after announcing the start of what it calls the ground maneuver in southern Lebanon, the IDF still cannot expose its tanks and military vehicles on the Lebanese side for fear of being targeted, and positions them in concealed places, and despite that, they are targeted with missiles and artillery shells and suffer heavy losses.

– The Israeli enemy has failed, until the time of this statement, to control any of the strategic hills it is trying to advance to, and is satisfied with reaching some houses on the outskirts of some border villages with the aim of taking a few pictures and organizing media visits.

– The Israeli army uses the homes of settlers in settlements in northern occupied Palestine as gathering centers for its officers and soldiers, and its military bases that manage the aggression against Lebanon are also located inside settlement neighborhoods in major occupied cities such as Haifa, Tiberias, Acre, and others. These homes and military bases are targets for Hezbollah, and accordingly we warn the settlers from being near these military gatherings in order to preserve their lives.

- Our brave fighters continue to confront the enemy, which is suffering embarassing defeats, to the point that it has begun to hide behind UNIFIL positions and in paths that are invisible to the Lebanese side.

– Until now, the enemy has not succeeded in entering our villages, and has suffered heavy losses exceeding 35 dead and 200 wounded among its elite officers and soldiers.

– What the enemy is witnessing is only some of the severe might that awaits him wherever he steps foot further into southern Lebanon.

– We say to our honorable people, you are in the hearts of all our mujahideen, you are our heroes that humiliate this enemy, you are the shouts of Takbir in the field, and you are the prayers of victory with which we come closer to God. 

– As for our beloved Gaza, we are committed to our covenant and our promise, and we will never abandon our support for the people in the Gaza Strip and their brave and honorable resistance.

2024-10-06T23:27:47+00:00,-1001626824086,"— October 7th was a day of major military achievements for the Palestinian resistance. However, it was also the start of a genocide that has lasted a year and killed more than 40,000 innocent Gazans, including many women and children.

Therefore, while not discounting the major impact and lasting effects of this historic day, I think it is inappropriate to express any congratulations, out of respect for the families and the martyrs.

While most Gazans agree that October 7th was necessary and the Israelis deserved it after years of brutal oppression, it also marked a point that would change their lives forever. Did the situation of the people of Gaza improve? Did they gain more freedom? Are they less oppressed now? No. In fact, things are worse now. Much worse.

October 7th is not something to ""celebrate"". You dont celebrate an event that led to the deaths of 40,000 people. Don't get me wrong, Israel is the only one to blame for this. But war is not fun, it is not cool, and it isn't entertainment. Don't treat it lightly.

October 7th was a necessary hurdle on the long road to Palestinian liberation, to get back ALL of occupied Palestine. And its effects on the Zionist entity will become apparent in the future. But war is not a football match. 

The people on the ground don't care about political victories, about national pride, or about revenge. The people care about seeing their families again, about moving back to their homes, about being able to cook their favourite dish, and being able to get married and see their children grow up.

It is easy for us, across the world, to celebrate an event that affected none of us directly. Resistance is not without sacrifice, but let's not pretend that this victory came easy and that there's nothing to grieve over. October 7th was a major and necessary achievement, but don't act like it's all moonshine and fairy dust. 

All I'm saying is, try not to forget your humanity. If you want to, celebrate, but be mindful that you do not get insensitive towards human suffering, even after such major victories. Whatever had to be done, was done. This was simply a duty, not an event for enjoyment or entertainment.

The first image shows Iran's seismic event last night, which happened in the Kavir desert near a town called Aradan. The other images compare seismic vibrations from earthquakes vs nuclear tests; the Iranian seismic event looks more like an underground nuclear test than an earthquake. One tell-tale sign is that there was not a single 'after shock'.

There is no conclusive evidence yet. But this is starting to look more and more interesting. Just yesterday, prominent Iranian politicians said Iran needs to establish a 'new grade of deterrence', possibly referring to nuclear weapons.

2024-10-04T15:03:05+00:00,-1001626824086,"The IDF claims it killed 250 Hezbollah fighters in the past 4 days, which is actually delusional. At least make your lies believable.

That would be 62 dead fighters each day. For comparison, during the height of the Vietnam War, which saw 58,220 total U.S. combat deaths, about 12 American soldiers died each day on average. 

That means Israel is killing Hezbollah fighters at 4x the pace (allegedly)."
2024-10-04T14:54:11+00:00,-1001626824086,"— Scott is right. Many of the missiles were simply intended to overwhelm Israeli air defenses, if any of them actually hit it would be an 'added bonus'. They did have target coordinates input, of course, for the case that they did manage to bypass defenses.

The blue circles are likely the targets Iran REALLY cared about and actually wanted to hit. That's why we used Kheybar Shekan and Kheybar Shekan-2, one of our most accurate missiles in the arsenal. If we actually wanted to make sure of destroying the F-35 hangars, we would've used a much larger quantity of these.

Keep in mind that Iran still hasn't used the 'Khorramshahr-4' LRBM, which has a warhead of 1,500kg and could be devastating if they make any direct hits.

Iran's Fattah-1 and Kheybar Shekan missiles, which are considered more advanced and maneuverable, have a much smaller warhead than these heavy liquid-fueled missiles. Those are the missiles that pass Israeli defenses 80% of the time.

Most of Iran's heavy liquid-fueled missiles like Emad and Qadr-H were intercepted during the April attack, so I'm beginning to suspect that a major cyberattack was conducted against the Israeli air defenses, which the IRGC has indeed claimed.

Satellite imagery has been released from within the red box, which is only a small part of the larger Nevatim airbase. As of now, we can see 5 hits within this area: One direct hit on an Israeli C-130, which was removed from its parking spot after being hit. One direct hit on a protected hangar for Israeli AEW/C (Airborne Early Warning & Control) planes, with several of them possibly damaged or destroyed, if they were present in the hangar during the strike. Another hit slightly missed this hangar. The other two strikes hit the tarmac.

This is only a small part of the Nevatim airbase, and as the days pass, we will likely receive more satellite imagery. If there are 5 confirmed impacts in this section alone, the rest of the base was likely damaged heavily as well. And we have not yet seen any imagery from Tel Nof airbase in Tel Aviv.

Fateh, Fattah and Fath are all Iranian ballistic missiles, but they are all different from one another. You cannot use these interchangably. The spelling is similar, but they're DIFFERENT missiles.

Fateh (Fateh-110 and Fateh-313) written as فاتح in Persian, is a short range ballistic missile. It's extremely accurate, but its range is very limited. These are usually the missiles used by Iran when attacking targets in neighouring Iraq, or by Hezbollah inside Israel. Top image shows this missile.

Fattah (Fattah-1 and Fattah-2) written as فتّاح in Persian, is a medium range hypersonic ballistic missile. It's extremely fast and very accurate. It was officially revealed in 2023, and Iran used it against Israel last night, in limited numbers alongside various other missiles. Bottom left image shows this missile.

Fath (Fath-360) written as فتح in Persian, also known as BM-120 in export, is a short range satellite-guided tactical ballistic missile, which is launched from canisters. The system fills a similar role as the American HIMARS, and Russia allegedly acquired this system from Iran recently for use in Ukraine. Bottom right image shows it.

2024-10-02T01:00:58+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷/🇮🇱 Iran's attack in April was a message and a show of force. The attack was extensively telegraphed for over 2 weeks, and Iran gave advance warning to the US in order to avoid an all-out war.

This time, Iran did not inform anyone. US intelligence only detected the attack about 2 hours before it happened. There were also no NOTAMs issued in Iranian airspace, which usually signals an imminent attack. Iran also decided to carry out the attack with ballistic missiles only, which arrive in Israel within ~15 minutes, giving Israel virtually no time to respond. Most US aircraft carriers recently left, something Iran was waiting for. Everything shows that Iran really aimed to re-establish deterrence this time, while still not going 'all-out'.

All in all, it seems that today was for real. We'll have to wait to assess the damage, and Israel will try to cover up as much as possible, as usual. From the videos that are available, I would estimate at least 60-70 impacts in total, and that's a conservative estimate. We won't know for sure until the satellite images get released in a few days.

Until then, we wait for a potential Israeli response. Last time, there was virtually none, but this time seems different. In any case, this was only the first wave, and the IRGC has prepared for an unprecedented exchange that could last multiple months.

2024-10-01T21:00:59+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Statement by the General Staff of the Iranian Armed Forces (summarized):

'Following the illegitimate actions of the Zionist regime, by assassinating our military advisors in Syria and Lebanon, and assassinating the leaders of the resistance, especially the martyrs Ismael Haniyeh and Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and especially its massacres in the Gaza Strip and Lebanon, a harsh military response was necessary.

The Islamic Republic of Iran, in the past 45 years, has never initiated any war, but will not hesitate to act in self-defence with exemplary strength and power.

The General Staff of the Armed Forces thanks all the different branches of the Armed Forces that took part in today's operation: the IRGC Aerospace Force, the Army, and the Ministry of Defense. 

If the Zionist regime retaliates against Iran, it must wait for the destruction of its military infrastructure in the occupied Palestinian territories. In case of direct US-support for Israel in any attack on Iran, their facilities and bases in the region will be targeted in a harsh and regretful manner.'

Only a few ballistic missiles were shot down by US Patriot battery in Iraq and Aegis-equipped ships in the Mediterranean, with Israel’s Arrow-2/3 air defences handing the vast majority.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-09-30T17:05:20+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇱🇧/🇮🇱 A short paragraph about Israel's upcoming ground offensive into Lebanon:

Everything the Israeli leadership is saying now, regarding the elimination of Hezbollah's capabilities, they also said in 2006 (quote above), and they still ended up losing the war.

Although a significant portion of Hezbollah's leadership has been eliminated, all of those high-ranking commanders have already been replaced. Hezbollah always knew that their commanders were at risk of assassination, and it's extremely naive to assume they would not have contingency plans for situations like these.

Besides this, Hezbollah is an assymetrical military force, its units operate mostly independently based on the initiatives of local field commanders. Even if there is no active central leadership (which isn't the case currently), the resistance will continue on the ground.

When it comes to Hezbollah's missile arsenal, Israel claims it destroyed more than half of the group's capabilities within the past week. However, this is likely exaggerated, as most of the airstrike targets were part of a pre-planned databank based on old or obsolete intelligence. Hezbollah is dynamic, it can move launchers around very quickly. 

It's likely that Hezbollah's long-range and medium-range missile capabilities were affected to some extent by the recent strikes, but not enough for its missile threat to be fully neutralized. It should be noted that Hezbollah's strategic assets, such as ballistic missiles, are stored in hardened bases underground. Many of them are located in Syria and the Beqaa. When it comes to short range missiles, that's another matter; Hezbollah will simply never run out, they just have too much stuff.

Hezbollah's main disadvantage currently is Israel's superior air power and surveillance. They likely still have the weapons systems to carry out major missile attacks against Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, but such large-scale attacks would require extensive planning and staging, and during the staging phase Israel would likely detect the accumulation of launchers beforehand and strike Hezbollah's launcher formations pre-emptively. This means Hezbollah currently has to resort to 'shoot-and-run' tactics, sporadically launching missiles from blind spots and immediately relocating to a different location.

Hezbollah's real strength lies in its ground combat in the South. Hezbollah is intertwined with the local population, almost every southern Lebanese village has a Hezbollah garrison of a few hundred to a few thousand fighters, which are commanded independently and are well-armed. Most importantly, they possess an advantage that Hamas does not; modern Iranian-made ATGMs, in extremely large quantities. 

In 2006 we saw the villages of Bint Jbeil and Ayta al-Sha'ab resisting against the IDF for multiple weeks with only their local Hezbollah garrisons, in some cases only dozens of fighters against thousands of Israeli forces. The IDF was forced to leave both of these cities, taking a huge amount of losses. Hezbollah is much stronger now than in 2006, and it is better organized and better supplied. Israel is in for a hard battle.

'Islamic Group' (Al-Jama'ah Al-Islamiyyah) is a Sunni Islamist political party in Lebanon that also has an armed wing, the 'al-Fajr Forces'. They are the Lebanese branch of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The party is not in complete political alignment with Hezbollah, but considers itself an ally of Hezbollah when it comes to resisting against Israel, and for the first time in almost 20 years of military inactivity they launched missiles into Israel during the current war in Gaza.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-09-29T22:50:49+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 To those who are confused, asking if Iran's Supreme Leader has full authority:

Yes, the Supreme Leader in Iran TECHNICALLY has full authority, especially regarding foreign policy and national security matters. He is the Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces, and the highest political and religious authority in the country. He is the Wali al-Faqih (Guardian Jurist), somewhat like the Pope for Catholics back in the day, having both spiritual and political power.

However, Ayatollah Khamenei, the current Supreme Leader for the past 35 years, rarely ever uses his executive power. If he wants to, he can issue a 'Hokm-e Hokoomati' (Executive Order) which must be obeyed and carried out by the government, but this rarely happens.

In reality, the Supreme Leader mostly acts as a 'guide'. He publicly gives his opinion about something, and the current administration is expected to act roughly in line with the Supreme Leader's vision, even if they are not an explicit unequivocal order.

For example, in the case of Ismael Haniyeh's assassination, the Supreme Leader, both privately and publicly, claimed that Iran must carry out a 'blood vengeance' and retaliate for this crime. As mentioned before, this statement mostly acts as a guideline, not a direct order. Khamenei does this because if he signs too many executive orders, he will be seen as a dictator, especially by the more liberal factions of Iranian society. He also believes that the President, due to his democratic election, has a mandate of the people.

In the case of Haniyeh's assassination, the new Pezeshkian administration, despite being clearly instructed to retaliate, decided to make a compromise with the US instead, and to retaliate at a later time in exchange for a ceasefire in Gaza. Obviously, this didnt't happen, and now many Iranians are pissed off that the Supreme Leader's instructions were bypassed.

For the record, the Supreme Leader could have easily chosen to simply directly order the strike on Israel, nobody could have disobeyed it, but it would have been perceived as undermining the new administration, which was clearly opposed to a strike in the immediate timeframe. 

Ayatollah Khamenei has always taken the position of being a 'concerned father'; he gives the government and the President a lot of freedom to do whatever they want, even if it goes against his guidelines, because he hopes they will realize that relying on the West simply does not work. Clearly, even after the past 45 years, the Reformists have not yet come to this realization, unlike the 'Hardliners' such as Raeesi and Jalili.

It is possible that after this incident, the Supreme Leader will still decide to directly order a strike against Israel after all, regardless of Pezeshkian's wishes. He was simply trying to keep the national unity.

2024-09-28T15:58:51+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Full statement by the Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic, Imam Khamenei:

'The great mujahid, the flag-bearer of resistance in the region, the virtuous religious scholar, the mastermind, the political leader, His Eminence Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, may God be pleased with him, attained the honor of martyrdom in the events in Lebanon last night, and rose towards God's heavenly kingdom. 

The beloved Master of Resistance finally received the reward of decades of jihad in the way of Allah, and endured its hardships during a holy battle. He was martyred while he was busy planning to defend the defenseless people of the Beirut suburbs, their destroyed homes, and their loved ones who were torn to pieces. He also fought for decades to defend the people of Palestine who were subjected to injustice and oppression, their usurped cities and villages, their destroyed homes, and their loved ones who died in the countless Zionist massacres. 

The honor of martyrdom was his undisputed right after all this lengthy jihad. The Islamic world has lost a great personality, the Resistance Front has lost a prominent flag-bearer, and Hezbollah has lost an unparalleled leader, but the blessings of his planning and jihad over the course of these decades will never end. 

The foundations he laid in Lebanon, and through which he directed all the centers of resistance, will not disappear with his absence, but will in fact grow stronger and more solid with the blessing of his blood and the blood of all the martyrs. And the strikes of the resistance front against the miserable and decaying body of the Zionist entity will become, by God’s will and power, more devastating and destructive. 

The malicious Zionist entity did not achieve victory in this incident, as the master of resistance was not just a person, but rather an approach and a school of thought, and this approach will continue. Just as the blood of martyr Sayyed Abbas al-Musawi was not shed in vain, the blood of martyr Sayyed Hassan will not be in vain either. 

I offer my condolences and congratulations to the virtuous wife of the dear Sayyed, who also sacrificed her son Sayyed Hadi for the sake of God, and to her virtuous sons, and the families of the martyrs in this incident, as well as to every individual in Hezbollah, and to the dear people and senior officials in Lebanon, and to all parts of the resistance front, and to the entire Islamic nation, on the martyrdom of the great Nasrallah and his martyred companions. 

I declare a five-day general mourning in the Islamic nation of Iran. I ask God to gather him with His close servants. And peace be upon the righteous servants of God.'

The terrorist gang ruling the Zionist regime did not learn from their one-year criminal war in Gaza and failed to understand that the mass killing of women, children and civilians cannot affect the strong structure of the resistance's organization and destroy it. Now they are trying the same foolish policy in Lebanon.

The Zionist criminals should know that they are too small to cause significant damage to the strong structure of Hezbollah in Lebanon. All the resistance forces of the region are with Hezbollah and support it. The fate of this region will be determined by the resistance forces and at the head of them is the proud Hezbollah.

The people of Lebanon have not forgotten that once upon a time, the military of the Zionist regime used to put Beirut under their boots. It was Hezbollah that cut off their legs and made Lebanon free and proud. Even today Lebanon will make the aggressor and evil dark enemies regret their actions.

It is obligatory for all Muslims to stand proudly with the people of Lebanon and Hezbollah with all their resources and help it in confronting the usurping, cruel and evil regime.'

It's no secret that Iran has been looking to assassinate Trump for his role in the Soleimani strike, but I highly doubt Iran was behind these two amateur attempts.

But if Iranian apps are found on the shooter's phone, that is VERY worrying, because it means the media is trying to spin a story to influence public opinion against Iran. And we all know what that means. This is the type of stuff that starts wars.

He also says the first shooter had '3 potentially foreign-based apps' on his phone, which could imply that the shooter used Iranian apps, such as 'Baleh' or 'Eitaa', messaging apps based in Iran; Trump says they haven't been able to crack them yet.

Today, the Trump campaign officially revealed that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence had briefed the campaign about 'real and specific threats from Iran to assassinate Trump' to 'sow chaos' in the United States.

The sheer incompetence of the liberal Pezeshkian government is a true embarassment to the Islamic Republic.

In these difficult days that the noble Lebanese people are going through, as they are increasingly exposed to brutal Israeli aggression and savage acts, including the bombing of large numbers of personal communication devices and the like, targeting homes crowded with citizens, even women and children, and launching intensive raids on dozens of villages and towns in the south and the Bekaa, which has resulted - so far - in the martyrdom and wounding of a large numbers of heroic resistance fighters and other innocent civilians and the displacement of tens of thousands from their homes and houses, the supreme religious authority expresses its solidarity with the dear Lebanese and his condolences to them in their great suffering, raising its hands in supplication to God Almighty to protect them and shield them and repel from them the evil of the wicked and the plots of the wrongdoers, and to include their righteous martyrs with mercy and contentment and grant the wounded and injured a speedy recovery.

While calling for every possible effort to stop this ongoing barbaric aggression and protect the Lebanese people from its devastating effects, he calls on the believers to do whatever contributes to alleviating their suffering and securing their humanitarian needs. 

May God protect Lebanon and its dear people from all harm and misfortune.'

Yet, without hesitation, on October 8th, less than a day after the attack, Hezbollah started bombing northern Israel out of solidarity with their brothers in Palestine.

Those who say Hezbollah isn't 'doing enough', they gave 500 martyrs since the beginning of the war, and they are not stopping their operations despite immense domestic and foreign pressure, simply because they consider it their selfless duty.

This cannot be said about the Arab nations in the region, who have not lifted a single finger in support of Palestine, yet complain about the Resistance on a daily basis.

According to Israeli journalist Barak Ravid, citing U.S. and Israeli officials, Israel decided to blow up the pager devices yesterday because two Hezbollah members had raised suspicion regarding the pagers, and Israel did not want to risk the operation being discovered before being implemented.

A former Israeli official with knowledge of the operation said Israeli intelligence services planned to use the booby-trapped pagers it managed to plant in Hezbollah's ranks as a surprise opening blow in an all-out war to try to cripple Hezbollah's internal communications.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his top ministers and the heads of the Israel Defense Forces and the intelligence agencies decided to use the system now rather than take the risk of it being detected by Hezbollah, a U.S. official said.

Minutes before the attack, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called his American counterpart, Lloyd Austin, to inform him of an upcoming operation, without providing details.

First of all, the IRGC does not carry foreign pagers, they carry Iranian-made pagers only. 

Second of all, the claim of 19 killed in Syria is ridiculous, considering the fact that only 12 people officially died across all of Lebanon so far.

2024-09-17T19:05:09+00:00,-1001626824086,"I'm wondering something.

Supposedly, all of these pagers were rigged before distribution to Hezbollah by an intermediary. For example, some Lebanese distributor bought them from Taiwan and Hezbollah bought them off him.

Now, we know that all of the pagers exploded at the same time. 

I'm wondering if there's any room / storage facility inside Lebanon that stores these things. That would have caused a large scale explosion at the storage site due to many pagers being in the same place. In all likelihood, Hezbollah now knows the location where they were stored before distribution.

Which would lead back to the intermediary. And possibly those above him. It would reveal some connections."

1. Yemen lightens the warheads of its ballistic missiles to increase the range, as Yemen is much further from Israel than Iran. This would lead to a lesser warhead and less impact.

2. Yemeni production of Iranian missiles are lesser quality, both in terms of the materials used and the production methods applied. The missile might have disintegrated shortly before impact, due to the immense heat.

3. An Israeli air defense intercepted the missile just before impact, and the small craters / fires are a result of the shrapnel falling down.

4. Yemen somehow used a cluster warhead. This is unlikely because this specific missile hasn't been seen with a cluster warhead before, and its warhead is already relatively light.

Before that, Yemen announced they had started domestic production of Iran's original Kheybar Shekan under the name 'Palestine' (Falasteen). The Kheybar Shekan-2 or 'Hatem-2' is simply an upgraded version of this missile with a hypersonic warhead and added range and maneuvers.

While this mission is one of the smaller ones we did, this is because we wanted to do it as fast as possible to coincide with 100k subs, which came faster than expected.

In this operation, Middle East Spectator and subscribers fed 15 displaced families in the Gaza Strip. Each family got one chicken, 1kg of rice, and a bottle of cooking oil. 

This mission was done in cooperation with our intermediaries at Palestine Market.

The morning following 9/11, thousands of Iranians gathered in the streets of the capital Tehran to hold a candlelight vigil for the victims. According to eyewitnesses, the vigil lasted for several miles.

At Tehran's largest soccer stadium, a crowd of 60,000 people observed a minute of silence and recited prayers for those killed, before the start of Iran's World Cup qualification match.

On the same day, the Iranian President at the time, Mohammad Khatami, said the following: 'On behalf of the Iranian people and the Islamic Republic of Iran, I denounce this terrorist act, which led to the killing of defenseless people, and I express my deepest sorrow and sympathy with the American people.'

The Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, also commented on the attack: 'Islam condemns the massacre of defenseless people, whether Muslim or Christian or others, anywhere and by any means. However, this act should not be used as a pretext to carry out any attack on Afghanistan, which will lead to another human tragedy.'

'In the past 6 years, we have fought a covert battle against the Zionist enemy and their allies on the world's oceans.

During these years, 14 of our commercial ships, mostly oil tankers, were attacked or threatened by the Zionists and their helpers, to prevent our oil exports across the world. These actions were carried out very covertly, and rarely ever published.

When we realized who was behind this global sabotage effort, we targeted a total of 12 Israeli-linked vessels, and when we struck the 5th vessel, in the northern Indian Ocean, the enemy surrendered and said they will no longer target our shipping.

The British seized one of our ships in the Strait of Gibraltar, and in response we seized the 'STENA IMPERO' oil tanker, and they gave up. Similarly, Greece seized two of our ships at the request of the U.S. but they also capitulated after pressure.

In another incident, two of our oil tankers were en-route to Venezuela and the U.S. threatened to seize them. We announced over the radio that we would seize a US-flagged oil tanker if they did this, and they decided to abort the mission.'

It has been known for months that the US and other adversaries have attempted (apparently successfully) to smuggle Starlink equipment into Iran to sow internal discord by providing unobstructed internet access to dissident groups.

Another factor is Iran's severe internet censorship, which is some of the most strict in the entire world. Many Iranian politicians are now calling for the end of excessive filtering, arguing that it is indirectly and inadvertently pushing people into searching for external solutions to bypass censorship, like Starlink. 

An Iranian political analyst says the following: 'We should prioritize decreasing the amount of internet censorship, even if we disagree with this in principle, because otherwise people will find external ways to bypass it, such as Starlink, which constitutes a national security issue.'

The grandfather of the current Emir, Sheikh Salman bin Hamad Al-Khalifah, who ruled Bahrain at that time, pledged allegiance to Iran in 1958, a year after Bahrain was officially declared an Iranian province.

Before 1957, Iran considered Bahrain as a part of Fars Province, despite exercising no effective control over the island, which was ruled mostly by the British, together with Qatar and the Trucial States (UAE) in what was known as the 'Persian Gulf Residency', a subdivision of the British Empire.

But, throughout the majority of Bahrain's history, it was a Persian island, and for this reason the country is still majority Shia until this day, and many Bahraini citizens have Iranian ancestry and pro-Iran political views.

• Trump had wanted to announce the embassy move during his first foreign policy trip overseas in 2017, but McMaster argued against this, convincing Trump to delay the announcement by 6 months in order to try and extract more concessions from Israel.

• McMaster also recalls warning Netanyahu about his approach towards Putin in 2018, urging Netanyahu to 'reconsider his relations with Russia.'

2024-08-26T13:05:15+00:00,-1001626824086,"🇮🇶🇷🇺🖇️ Yesterday, we participated in a meeting with the Prime Minister of Iraq, Muhammad Shia al-Sudani, in Baghdad. The format of the meeting did not allow for a wide range of issues to be discussed, but for our team, this was the first such event with the participation of a sitting foreign leader.

Among other things, one point stood out strongly: al-Sudani particularly emphasized the importance of the media and creating conditions to invite foreign journalists instead of obstructing them. According to him, this is the way to break the prevailing stereotypes in the press about the state of affairs in Iraq and create a positive image of the country in the world.

At the same time, the very fact that the head of state is inviting representatives of the Russian information and analytical media network to a meeting speaks to a certain understanding by the Iraqi authorities of the role of Telegram in the modern information war. The importance of which, in al-Sudani's administration, is apparently generally recognized.

And if that's the case, then specific points of contact in this area can quite possibly be found.

2024-08-22T08:37:17+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 🇮🇷 Iran's Space Program: A Cover for ICBM testing?

In recent months, Iran has been launching a large amount of satellites into space, using several different SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle) rockets.

One of these SLVs in particular, the Qaem-100, a three-stage solid-fuel rocket, looks and functions very similar to an ICBM in development, epecially after its recent modifications.

When Qaem-100 was revealed in 2022, as well as the version that was used while unsuccessfully launching the 'Nahid' satellite in 2023, it had a rounded tip. Additionally, the rocket also featured roll-control thrusters. 

In Qaem-100's new launch, which took place two days ago while sucessfully putting the 'Soraya' satellite into 750km orbit, we can see that there have been several modifications to the rocket.

Firstly, the tip of the rocket has become sharpened. This is typical in the design of long range missiles such as ICBMs. Second, the liquid-fuel roll thrusters have been omitted, to improve the missile's shelf life and decrease maintenance. Lastly, four stabilizing fins have been added, a common feature found in ICBMs.

While Iran has always been interested in expanding its space program for scientific and civilian purposes, it is likely that the launch of SLVs, in particular the Qaem-100, are a cover for testing a preliminary ICBM model. The launching of satellites is an added bonus.

This, in combination with Iran doubling its production of highly enriched U-235 uranium to 9kg a month, poses a real challenge to Israel and the United States, who now have to deal with Iran being a latent nuclear power.

2024-08-20T23:11:24+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇱/🇵🇸 From the above information, we can sort of conclude what type of deal the Israelis have been proposing:

– A temporary humanitarian ceasefire in return for some of the hostages, and then a phased withdrawal of the IDF from most of Gaza, simultaneous with the release of the remaining hostages, leading into a permanent ceasefire, but with the IDF staying to monitor the Egypt-Gaza border and the Netzarim Corridor in specific.

Basically, Israel is willing to give Hamas the 'permanent ceasefire' it wants, but only if the IDF will remain stationed in specific areas of the Gaza Strip, to monitor movement of people and goods.

Obviously, this is unacceptable to Hamas, and it makes sense why they pulled out of the negotiations. Per the deal that Biden proposed a few months ago, the IDF would withdraw fully from the Gaza Strip, and Hamas was ready to take this proposal, until Netanyahu changed it.

Therefore, there is a total breakdown of talks between Israel and Egypt.

On the other hand, Hamas also insists on a full withdrawal of IDF forces from the entire Gaza Strip, but Netanyahu insists on retaining a presence, including in the Netzarim Corridor, which cuts Gaza in half. This is why Hamas does not agree.

It makes sense for Iraq to go for these. They can give decent BVR capability owing to their integration with the potent PL-12 BVR missile and AESA radar.

Block III JF-17s are an excellent 4.5th Gen platform. They can carry an extremely diverse range of Pakistani, Chinese, and Turkish weapons, and it gives any prospective buyer a plethora of ordnance options, Many of which can be purchased from Pakistan as part of the deal as well.

With the JF-17 and its Pakistani and Chinese components, Iraq can rest easy knowing it won't have to face the strings that usually come attached to American platforms - for instance, the US refusing to equip the Iraqi F-16s with BVR missiles. 

These planes will finally give the Iraqi Air Force some teeth. (Teeth that their F-16s lack, hence why they are often called toothless Vipers)

The base is set to become the largest underground missile facility in the entire country. Construction started 10 years ago in 2014, and is set to be completed in the near future.

Observers have pointed out that the base consists of various different entrances and a vast tunnel network that stretches for several kilometers. Within the base, there are rooms and facilities for the production, launch and storage of at least thousands of ballistic missiles. There are also laboratories and gas-proof chambers.

For years, it has been speculated that this base has the possibility of becoming Iran's main base for testing and developing nuclear weapons, as it is located 700 meters below the Alborz mountain range, deep enough to resist any conventional strike.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-08-05T21:23:51+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷/🇮🇱 NOTE: While Iran keeps repeating that it will respond (and it will), it is much harder for Israel, the U.S. and their allies to predict exactly when.

Last time, it was about sending a message. It was a show of force. Iran knew that the 400-500 explosive-laden drones would take many hours to arrive in Israel, and that they would almost all be intercepted on the way to their targets. This also showed the traitors among the Arab nations. It was Iran's first direct attack on Israel and they did not know how Israel would respond.

The point was to show that it would take the entire U.S. Air Force, U.S. Navy, RAF, French Air Force, Jordanian Air Force & the Israeli Air Force to intercept them. As I said, it was a show of force. The missiles also largely consisted of older variants, used as decoys, while the small amount of 'modern' missiles such as the 'Kheybar Shekan' all hit their targets, although purposely avoiding massive damage to the Israeli airbases and striking the runways instead.

This time, Iran likely will not use drones or even cruise missiles. It might be an attack consisting solely of ballistic missiles, which take only 12 minutes to reach Israel and require much less staging / preparation.

Not only is it much more difficult for the United States to know about the exact timing of the attack because Iran refuses to communicate, it will also take U.S. intelligence way longer to detect the signs of an imminent attack; Iran's ballistic missiles can be launched from silos and mobile launch platforms within minutes.

Additionally, some people say that Iran spends too much time telegraphing its response. Iran does this because it doesn't just want to restore deterrence, it wants the world to see. 

On April 13th, it took 5 nations to intercept Iran's extremely 'tame' attack; and even then, all of the Iranian advanced missiles got through the defenses & hit their targets.

It doesn't matter how long Israel prepares, Iranian missiles are capable of penentrating defenses as demonstrated on April 13. It's a matter of intent, not capability. People who think it makes a difference whether Iran attacks now or in one week; it doesn't. 

If Iran aims to cause casualties and damage, it will. Especially if we see large scale use of advanced missiles such as the Kheybar Shekan & Kheybar Shekan-2 (hypersonic), Khorramshahr-4 and Fattah (hypersonic).

'We strongly condemn the brutal Zionist aggression against Lebanon and the brotherly Lebanese people, which targeted a Hezbollah headquarters in the southern suburb of Beirut, and resulted in the martyrdom and injury of a number of innocent citizens, and we consider it a dangerous escalation for which the Nazi-Zionist occupation bears full responsibility.

We declare our full solidarity with brotherly Lebanon and the brothers in Hezbollah, and we affirm that the occupation’s arrogance and its attempt to restore its lost prestige and deterrence, by committing more crimes in Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen and the Middle East, will only be an uncalculated adventure, for which the occupation will pay dearly. The time for recklessness has ended. There is an occupation in our country and the Arab region.

In the face of this brutal aggression against Lebanon, we hold the American administration responsible for the occupation’s crimes and ongoing violations, through its continued open political and military support, which tempted the occupation and the neo-Nazis to commit more follies and crimes that threaten peace and security throughout the Middle East.

We call on all the forces, components and parties of the nation to unite and stand in solidarity with Lebanon and the brotherly Lebanese people and their valiant resistance that came out in defense of our oppressed Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip. We also call on the international community and the United Nations to assume their legal and political responsibilities in stopping the genocide and ethnic cleansing against our people, and stopping the aggression of the Zionists. Lebanon and the Lebanese people are on the path to ending the occupation of Palestine and our occupied Arab lands.'

In just two years, the Biden administration imposed over 6,000 sanctions on various countries. 

The United States is imposing sanctions at a record-setting pace again this year, with more than 60% of all low-income countries now under some form of financial penalty. 

U.S. officials are increasingly concerned about the effectiveness of sanctions as a means to isolate nations viewed as 'national security threats.' However, plans to reform the sanctions system have been shelved since 2021. 

The overuse of U.S. sanctions has made the tool significantly less valuable. In an article from May, WSJ wrote how Western sanctions have led to the creation of an 'Axis of Evasion' led by China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, and Venezuela, effectively foiling Washington's financial warfare.

What this effectively means is that all Lebanese citizens who are in the United States (unless they left the US recently or are already  on the way back to Lebanon) are free to extend their stay for as long as necessary and as long as the Memorandum is valid (18 months).

The United States Government cites ""humanitarian"" reasons, citing the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel.

What is glaring and uncomfortable about the issuance is that this was issued for the passport holders of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan before the Taliban took over the country, and that was by a few weeks, as the U.S saw the inevitable collapse of the government and the country.

The U.S most likely sees an inevitable invasion of Lebanon by Israel and has thus issued this Memorandum as a way to handle the state of affairs for Lebanese citizens in the U.S

The Memorandum can be read at the website of the White House.

🔶️ Sudan’s military government has fully restored diplomatic ties with Iran, ending an eight-year rupture instigated by Saudi Arabia.

🔶️ In separate meetings, Lieutenant General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, Sudan’s military ruler, received the credentials of Iran’s new ambassador, Hassan Shah Hosseini, and dispatched a Sudanese ambassador to Tehran, Abdelaziz Hassan Saleh.

🔶️ Additionally, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps dispatched several cargo flights to Sudan, allegedly bringing attack drones and other weapons.

🔶️ These developments coincide with a phase of growing cooperation among Arab regional powers to pressure Sudan’s military government to end the nation’s ongoing civil war though negotiations—an option that the military regime has rejected.

🔶️ The Arab powers have given little assistance to Sudan’s military government, which is fighting for its survival against the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary originating in the country’s western Darfur region.

🔶️ Based in Port Sudan, Sudan’s military junta has lost control of most of the capital Khartoum, vast parts of western Sudan, and two states in the nation’s agricultural heartland. If it continues to lose territory, it will rule over little more than a rump state along the Red Sea coast and the northern states neighboring Egypt.

2024-07-24T19:58:09+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇺🇸/🇮🇱/🇮🇷 The Abraham Alliance: Reality or Work of Fiction?

If the United States tried to form this alliance 10 years ago, I would have said that Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, Jordan and Egypt would have likely joined. With the Syrian war ongoing, fears about the Nuclear Program and anti-Iranian sentiment at a boiling point, Arab nations felt like they had something to prove.

However, in the Middle East anno 2024, with Iran as an emerging force that has imposed hard power equations upon its neighbours, and following the Iran-Saudi peace deal, I think such an alliance is not feasible. In the very best case scenario, the Kingdom of Jordan and Bahrain would join such an alliance. 

Saudi Arabia is openly interested in closer Iran-ties, the UAE mostly follows Saudi policy & is heavily dependent on Iranian imports, and Egypt has a history of refusing alliances and has bigger problems than Iran. None of these countries will be excited at the prospect of an anti-Iran alliance at a time when Iran is rapidly emerging as the pre-eminent geopolitical power in the Middle East.

Jordan, due to its dependence on NATO and the United States, is the most likely to be up for it. They were the only Arab nation to open their airspace to the Israeli Air Force when Iran launched its missile strikes against Israel in April of this year.

Bahrain, which houses the U.S. Persian Gulf fleet, while possiby interested in joining, has also openly voiced its interest in persuing a re-establishment of diplomatic ties with the Islamic Republic of Iran.

In short: the 'Abraham Alliance' will likely end up as a shell of what it could have once been. It will be an empty, shallow alliance, consisting mostly of the United States and Israel, similar to operation Prosperity Guardian, which is widely seen as a flop.

Rural turnout has increased, and Jalili's campaign has been going village to village in order to convince the populace to vote, especially in Kurd / Turk provinces, who overwhelmingly voted for Pezeshkian.

2024-07-01T19:24:06+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Debate update: 

- Jalili, once again, sounds extremely professional and knows what he is talking about. He has plans and knows how to implement them. The problem is, he is TOTALLY unrelatable to the average joe. His rhetoric is way too formal and complicated. Like a university professor lecturing a group of students. Talks about 'strategic opportunities in cyberspace' and stuff.

- Pezeshkian, while not offering ANY real solutions, effectively mentions the people's problems and the matters which the ordinary Iranians care about. He clearly has no plans, but his rhetoric is very relatable and many Iranians will feel a connection. Sadly, this gives him an advantage.

We have to acknowledge that in the modern political landscape, the content of debates don't really matter, it's about being charismatic and making people believe like you care about them and understand their problems. The average person simply does not understand the intricacies of politics.

At this rate, Pezeshkian will probably win the election, unless something major happens or turnout is lower than expected.

I truly hope I am wrong.

🔶️ In a televised statement on the Egyptian Al-Qahera News Channel the day after he concluded his visit to Beirut, Hossam Zaki said: “In previous Arab League decisions, Hezbollah was designated as a terrorist organization, and this designation was reflected in the resolutions, leading to the severing of communication based on these decisions.”

🔶️ “The member states of the League agreed that the label of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization should no longer be employed,” Zaki said.

🔶️ The official attributed this decision to the fact that ""the designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization no longer applies,"" emphasizing that ""the Arab League does not maintain terrorist lists and does not actively seek to designate entities in such a manner.""

🔶️ On March 11, 2016, the Arab League classified Hezbollah as a ""terrorist organization,"" with reservations from Lebanon and Iraq, and called for it to ""cease promoting extremism and sectarianism, refrain from meddling in the internal affairs of countries, and withhold any support for terrorism and terrorists in the region.""

🔶️ According to a statement by the Arab League on Friday, Zaki, during his visit that began on Tuesday, held meetings with Lebanese officials, as well as various political and parliamentary leaders representing Lebanon's diverse political spectrum.

Recently, the Yemeni Armed Forces announced they had started domestic production of Iran's 'Kheybar Shekan' MRBM, under the name 'Palestine' (فلسطين).

Those among us with knowledge about Iran's missile program know that there exists an upgraded version of the Kheybar Shekan, namely the Kheybar Shekan-2, which is outfitted with a special cone tip. The Kheybar Shekan-2 is a hypersonic missile due to its upgraded design.

So, it seems that Iran has not only given Yemen the blueprints and expertise to build the regular Kheybar Shekan, but its most advanced, hypersonic brother: the 'Kheybar Shekan-2', under the Yemeni name 'Hatem-2'.

No Iranian hypersonic missiles were used in its attack on Israel, so the fact that they allow the Yemenis to possess such advanced equipment that even they themselves have not used, speaks volumes about how comitted Iran is to the Axis of Resistance and its allies.

They want 'their man' (Ghalibaf) to be in power. In 2021, they also supported a very obscure ex-IRGC Commander on social media, Saeed Mohammad, who nobody knew anything about.

Luckily he was disqualified by the Guardian Council, but the IRGC is getting involved more and more in political business, when they shouldn't. For now, I'm not worried, but this could turn into a problem in the future.

2024-06-26T12:19:30+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Iran Election Update: 

The race currently is between Pezeshkian (Reformist) and Jalili (Hardline). Ghalibaf (Populist) has been steadily losing ground.

However, sections within the IRGC are pushing more and more for the conservatives uniting behind Ghalibaf. He was an important IRGC commander for a long time, and enjoys a lot of support within the military file and amongst the regime's 'elites'.

They are currently spreading various campaigns on social media saying that Jalili should drop out in favor of Ghalibaf, or otherwise people will risk a Pezeshkian win in the first round.

IRGC-aligned channels are also saying that a vote for Jalili is a wasted vote, and that all conservatives / revolutionaries must vote for Ghalibaf in order to secure a strong victory.

In reality, it is quite the opposite: If Ghalibaf drops out in favor of Jalili, he has a good chance of winning the election. Jalili is polling higher than Ghalibaf, so it's only natural for him to stay in the race, which he has clearly said he would.

Ghalibaf supporters fear that Jalili doesn't have enough support among the various classes of Iranian society to win in the first round, and they assess that he might lose to Pezeshkian in a second round.

This Presidential race perfectly sums up the power structures within Iran: The revolutionary religious front, extremely loyal to Khamenei, on the one hand (Jalili); the military leadership and regime elites on the other hand (Ghalibaf); and the liberal reformist opposition (Pezeshkian).

I don't see how Iraq is supposed to be safer than Qatar. The United States carries out assassinations inside Iraqi territory on a monthly basis, with near impunity. Yes, Qatar might not be ideologically as close to Hamas, but I doubt Israel would publicly assassinate Hamas officials inside Doha.

This is clearly a politically motivated move, and Hamas obviously wants to start relying more on the Resistance Axis and the Islamic Republic of Iran. 

But if they want to get closer to Iran, then why not just relocate to Tehran? Iran is much safer than Iraq, Israel or the U.S. can't just carry out airstrikes as they please within Iran. Iraq is a borderline failed state, it will be extremely hard to protect Hamas from Israeli aggression over there.

My suspicion? Hamas, despite being pro-Resistance Axis, as a Sunni movement, is still hesitant about moving to a country with a Shia government. If they moved to Iran, Hamas' opponents would use this as a way to criticize them and prove their point that 'Hamas is the dog of Iran'. Also, they probably prefer being in an Arab nation, and Iran is not Arab.

Realistically, Hamas SHOULD move to Iran. Because Iraq is a country with very low state-autonomy and a low capacity to defend Hamas officials on its territory.

He also says that the obligatory Hijab rule should be abolished, that Islam does not command Hijab, and he referred to the 2022 Western-backed anti-government riots as 'peaceful protests'. 

Additionally, he calls for increased autonomy of ethnic groups within Iran, like Kurds and Turks, and has expressed Pan-Turkist ideas.

2024-06-22T16:17:14+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Iran's last official Presidential poll ahead of Friday's election

Jalili leads with 22.5%, followed by Ghalibaf at 19.5% and Pezeshkian at 19.4%, and the others below 3%.

The election will almost certainly go to a second round, because no candidate will get more than 50% of the votes in the first round.

At this point, with Jalili (Hardline) seemingly in first place, the race is on between Ghalibaf (Populist) and Pezeshkian (Reformist): 

If Ghalibaf (Populist) gets second place in the first round, the second round will be between Ghalibaf and Jalili (Hardline). This would be a showdown between Iran's moderately conservative populist flank and the hardline conservative religious flank. While the two have similarities and are both conservatives, Ghalibaf also appeals to middle class non-conservative Iranians, who see him as an experienced 'manager' who built Tehran into a powerhouse during his term as a competent mayor. Jalili's voterbase consists mostly of hardline revolutionary Iranians and the religious masses, as well as university educated youths and people from rural areas.

If Pezeshkian places second in the first round, the second round will be between Pezeshkian (Reformist) and Jalili (Hardline). This would be a showdown between Iran's liberal reformist flank and the hardline conservative religious flank. In this event, Jalili will likely take almost all the votes of those who voted for Ghalibaf in the previous round, because both are part of the wider conservative flank despite their differences. On the other hand, Pezeshkian could draw in large numbers of previous non-voters, mostly anti-IR Iranians, who will feel emboldened if a Reformist reaches the second round.

– Pezeshkian (Reformist): He appealed a lot to 'normies' in Iranian society. Used a lot of relatable rhetoric, kept things simple and tried to connect with the people, which is one of his strengths. Usually reformists like him try to talk 'common sense' and present themselves as being from among the people. He made a few major blunders, such as comparing Iran to Turkey. Unfortunately, he has no real plans for Iran's economy, and merely makes some nice promises which he won't be able to deliver on, except for trying to continue failed liberal policies that have already been proven not to work in the past, such as the Nuclear Deal, and over-reliance on the West. As of now, he still has a decent chance, especially being the only viable reformist candidate. Also, I must say he seems like a genuine guy who believes in what he says, unlike some previous reformists.

– Pourmohammadi (Moderate): Not good, not bad, mostly very boring and uncharismatic. Didn't seem to have the relevant expertise to properly engage in the debate, and repeated points that have been made by various others in the past. Lacks the guts to pick a side, and tries to somehow balance his ideas to appease both reformists and conservatives, alienating both as a result, because his points were way too general. He will likely drop out of the race soon.

– Ghazizadeh (Conservative): Good debater, knows what he is talking about & what he wants to say. He has a clear vision for Iran's economy, and is able and willing to elaborate on it. However, he lacks political and executive experience, making him a lightweight in Iran's political scene. He is mostly present in order to assist the other conservatives in the debate, and will likely drop out in favor of another candidate at some point.

– Zakani (Conservative): Very good debater, probably had the best or second best performance of the night. Has a clear vision, explains it well, and has the balls to take multiple shots at the other candidates. He is the only one who mentioned Iran's 'dollarization' problem, and emphasized on overcoming the sanctions by a surge in local production and other domestic ways. In previous elections, Zakani was a 'cover candidate' for Raisi, this time, he's really going all in. He already said he will stay in the race until the end, so it will be interesting to see what happens.

– Ghalibaf (Conservative): Disappointing performance, lots of populism. Has no real solution or vision, and mostly rambles about the problems while mentioning some vague ideas on how to solve it. He lacks a detailed plan to tackle the issues, and is mostly riding on his enormous political standing, experience, and name recognition. He failed to connect with the ordinary Iranians, and at times it even felt like he was talking to Iran's elites, rather than the population. He seemed a bit disconnected from reality. His neoliberal economics are very predictable, and he is too engrained in 'the system' to make the major changes needed in Iran. However, he still has a big chance, due to all his past experience and name recognition.

– Jalili (Conservative): Good performance, but somewhat lacking charisma. Has a very promising and detailed vision for the economy, is able to explain his plans flawlessly, and has plenty of evidence to back it up. At times, it feels like you're watching a university professor lecturing his students on a topic. On one hand this is good, because it shows extreme competency and knowledge of the subject matter, on the other hand he fails to be relatable to the ordinary Iranian. I really like Jalili's ideas on the economy, foreign policy and domestic policy, where he mostly advocates for self-sufficiency and knowledge-based economic growth. However, as I said, many viewers will find his arguments 'too intellectual' to connect with and to understand their relevance, which might influence his chances. Despite this, he still enjoys major support among educated Iranian religious youth.

2024-06-02T12:13:13+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 This will be the most important Presidential election in Iran's history

Iran is at a crossroads. On the brink of becoming a regional superpower, the next few years will be crucial for Iran's future. 

By far the most important aspects that the Iranian President wields considerable power over, are foreign policy and economic policy. The upcoming election poses some significant questions regarding these two.

Will the new President be of the Raeesi-camp, continuing the approach of martyr Abdollahian regarding strong regional and ideological diplomacy while mostly ignoring the Western powers, or will the new President take a different route, instead trying to re-establish more cordial relations with the the West and the United States, possibly in the form of a return to the Nuclear Deal, in an attempt to aleviate some of the imposed sanctions?

Will the new President focus on Iran's strength, self sufficiency and independence, through developing the industrial and nuclear sectors in Iran's own interest and investing in its mutually beneficial relationship with BRICS, or will he make Iran dependent on the Western hegemons and aim to disrupt the great era of self sufficiency that has been fostered? 

But perhaps even more importantly, will the new President continue the legacy of Neoliberal economics laid out by Rouhani & unfortunately continued by some members of the Raeesi team, or will he take a new route, and take the first steps in the de-dollarization of the Iranian economy & strengthening of the local currency, bringing a new era of opportunity and growth?

These are all questions no one knows the answer to, but they will shape the future of the Islamic Republic. But there's something else that's important and we should not forget. Something that might be even more important than all the above points.

The Supreme Leader of Iran, Imam Khamenei, is 85 years old, may God protect him. When the Leader dies, the sitting President will preside over the Assembly of Experts, the 88-member supervisory body that appoints Iran's new Supreme Leader. I am sure you all understand the implications. 

In conclusion, under Martyr President Raeesi we saw Iran enter an era of strength and self determination. Whether we will continue on this path will be determined by the upcoming Presidential election. It will be historic, that's for sure.

In 2021 all of them were disqualified, and this will likely be the case again. Iran's constitution says a رجل سياسى ('Political Man') is eligible to become President. Some have taken this to mean a 'Political Person' in general, but the prevailing view is that only men can become President.

According to Islam, women are held in extremely high esteem. However, they lack the necessary qualities for being a leader. Women are more emotional, and have a less fact-based approach. They also lack assertiveness.

According to sources on the internet, a cessation of hostilities is non-binding, and is usually applied when negotiations are still ongoing. 

This means that Israel could announce a cessation of hostilities to get back most of the hostages, and then continue the war nevertheless, claiming that they never agreed to a permanent ceasefire.

Language is EXTREMELY important in these types of diplomatic deals. Never trust America.

Hezbollah fighters under the command of Shahid Mustafa Badreddine mined an entire road with several IEDs, and waited for a column of hundreds of terrorists to approach the road, which had been under surveillance for days.

When the Al-Nusra terrorists finally marched onto the designated road, Hezbollah detonated the IEDs and opened heavy machine gun fire on the survivors.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-05-25T20:24:00+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 Iran's Presidential Election is in 34 days, here's what you need to know:

The political scene in Iran is extremely complicated, but when simplified, it basically consists of two main flanks: Conservatives and Moderates.

The Conservatives are politicians that fit squarely in the camp of the revolution. They stand 100% behind Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, and they are generally considered more loyal to the revolution's original values. They put emphasis on keeping Iran an Islamic, strong and independent nation, with a foreign policy that could be dubbed 'Iran-first', trying not to rely on outside powers. Most politicians who belong in this camp opposed the 2015 Nuclear Deal with the US, for example.

The Moderates, or sometimes called 'Reformists', take a more liberal approach to interpreting the values of the Islamic Revolution. They are still ostensibly in favour of the Islamic Republic and its ideals, but wish to modernize and reorganize the country in a way that they feel fits the current era. Most of them support less strict rules on Hijab, returning to negotiations with the United States, and neoliberal market economics. 

Some Moderate candidates are secretly anti-Islamic Republic, but hide behind their close relations with genuine pro-IR people to conceal their true views. They know they cannot voice their opposition publicly, because no one would vote for them, and they would get disqualified.

Iran's last Moderate President, Hassan Rouhani (President from 2013-2021) caused a major decline in economic development. By forming the Nuclear Deal with the U.S. in 2015, he put the Iranian economy at the mercy of foreign powers and investments. Khamenei, who was against the Nuclear Deal from the start, warned that the United States would never keep their end of the agreement. 

In 2017, he was proven right, and the U.S. unilaterally pulled out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, despite Iran's compliance, which was backed up by the IAEA. Inflation in Iran skyrocketed, and the economy experienced its worst state in 45 years. 

All of this led to the Conservative President Ebrahim Raeesi winning a 72% landslide victory in the 2021 election. Turnout hit a record low, because reformists had lost faith in their candidates due to past failures to deliver on their election promises. As a result, the vast majority of those who voted were hardline IR supporters. 

If President Raeesi ran for office again in 2025, he would most likely have won a second term. But due to his unforeseen martyrdom, others will have to stand up. Until now, we don't know the candidates, but I fully expect the Conservatives to win another landslide victory, as the Reformist voter base has become idle, and I doubt they will put up any meaningful candidates, unless they decide to put forward Javad Zarif, Iran's Foreign Minister from 2013-2021, who enjoys considerable support among Moderates.

Lastly, the dynamics of Iranian politics have changed quite a lot. Back in the 2000's and 2010's, if someone was anti-Islamic Republic, they would simply vote for a Reformist / Moderate candidate, to show their opposition to the regime. This was dangerous, because they actually had a way of changing the country's direction. Unlike what some people think, the President in Iran matters a lot.

Now, the people who are anti-IR simply don't vote at all, or cast blank protest votes, because they say 'all Iranian politicians are the same'. This is extremely dumb, they are shooting themselves in the foot, because if they all united to vote for a Reformist they could shake the country up pretty bad. But it is good for the Islamic Republic and its supporters, so I am quite happy they reached this conclusion, that they excluded themselves from the democratic process. 

Conclusion: Anti-IR Iranians likely won't vote at all, a small number of them will vote for the Moderate candidate, but the Conservative candidate will likely win another landslide victory like Raeesi in 2021, due to overwhelming participation of the pro-IR and religious masses.

'To God we belong, and to Him we all return. With great sadness and regret, I have received the bitter news of the martyrdom of the Martyr Scholar, the People's President with sufficient and hard work, the Servant of Al-Reza, peace be upon him, Hujjat Al-Islam Wa Al-Muslimeen, Mr. Hajj Seyyed Ibrahim Raisi and his dear companions, may God bless him and grant him peace.

This unfortunate incident happened during the line of duty. The entire period of responsibility of this noble and selfless person, both during the short term of his presidency and before that, was completely spent in non-stop efforts in serving the people, the country and Islam.

The dear President, he did not know fatigue (he worked tirelessly). In this tragic incident, the Iranian nation lost a sincere and valuable servant. For him, the welfare and satisfaction of the people, which is synonymous with God's satisfaction, was preferred over everything, so the ingratitude and taunts of some ill-wishers did not prevent him from working day and night to improve and and complete his affairs.

In this serious incident, prominent personalities such as Ayatollah Aale Hashem, the popular and reliable Friday Imam of Tabriz, Mr. Amir Abdollahian, the Mujahid and activist foreign minister, Mr. Malik Rahmati, the revolutionary and pious governor of East Azerbaijan, and the flight crew and other companions also joined the divine mercy.

I announce five days of public mourning and offer my condolences to the dear people of Iran. According to Article 131 of the Constitution, Mr. Mokhber is in the position of managing the executive branch and he is tasked to arrange with the heads of the legislative and judicial branches to elect a new president within a maximum of fifty days.

Finally, I offer my sincere condolences to the dear mother of Mr. Raeesi and his honorable wife and other survivors of the President and the respected families of his companions, especially the father of Mr. Al Hashem, and I ask for their patience and consolation and God's mercy for the departed.'

2024-04-22T19:37:33+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇱/🇮🇷 Israel's retaliatory strike against Iran: What are the facts?

- In the early morning of April 19th, a single fighter jet, likely an F35, took off from an airbase inside Israel.

- The jet made its way into Iraqi airspace, carrying three air-launchable ballistic missiles (ALBM), likely of the 'ROCKS' or 'Silver Sparrow' type.  

- Simultaneously, Israel mobilized one of its proxy groups inside Iran to launch at least three explosive-laden quadcopters at an S-300 radar near the 8th Shekari Airbase in Isfahan, attempting to disable it, in preparation for the upcoming missile strike.

- As the quadcopters approached their intended target, Iranian air defense autocannons engaged them, and successfully downed all three drones. 

As for what happened next, there are two main theories:

1. When Israel found out about the failure of the quadcopters to disable the radar, they decided to abort the mission and fire or despose of their missiles above Iraq. Three detached missile boosters were found in Iraqi territory to corroborate this theory.

2. Israel decided to go ahead with the operation, and launched all three 'ROCKS' / 'Silver Sparrow' missiles at an unknown target in Isfahan, likely the 8th Shekari Airbase. As the missiles approached the Iranian border, they were detected and shot down by Iran's 15th of Khordad air defense system, based in the city of Dezful. This theory is corroborated by the testimony of at least one trusted source inside Iran.

Why Iran did not respond

Due to the failing nature of the operation, as well as the lack of Israel taking official responsibility, Iran concluded that it had effectively achieved its goal of restoring deterrence, and there was no need for an escalation based on such a limited strike which was meant only to save face, in stark contrast to the massive Iranian missile strike carried out against Israel five days earlier. Iran won an important victory and set a new equation for years to come.

New satellite imagery from today, 22 April, shows for the first time a clear picture of the S-300 radar that was allegedly struck by Israeli quadcopters.

Experts had already pointed out that a missile impact was ruled out due to the lack of a significant crater, but now it can be confirmed that even the attack with quadcopters was fully repelled.

No damage to the radar can be observed, and the Israeli attack failed miserably and embarassingly.

2024-04-19T11:24:38+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷/🇮🇱 ANALYSIS: The Israeli missiles that were found in Iraq

Two Israeli missiles have been found in Iraq, one in Latifiyah and one in Aziziyah. Based on their exterior resemblance, they seem to be of the Blue Sparrow or Silver Sparrow missile type.

The Sparrow is an Israeli medium-range air-launched ballistic missile, which is currently in use as a target missile in the IDF, meaning, it is used to simulate an aerial target for defense systems like the Arrow-3, and in most cases it does not carry an active payload. 

Additionally, the Sparrow is a two-stage missile, meaning it consists of two parts, a booster and a warhead. The warhead detaches from the booster before entry. In two-stage missiles, the warhead does not travel much further than its detached booster, and the detached booster should be found not far away from the warhead's impact site.

However, as seen in the image above, even the closest booster that was found was located in Aziziyah, which is over 100km away from Iran. Based on where the missile booster landed, it is extremely unlikely that the warhead traveled more than a few kilometers into Iranian airspace, if it even entered at all, and if there even was an active payload.

After all this, while also keeping in mind the lack of visual evidence, it is inconceivable that even a single missile actually struck targets in Esfahan.

@Middle_East_Spectator"
2024-04-19T10:48:20+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷/🇮🇱 At this point, there are three main theories that I can think of:

1. Israel launched a small-scale quadcopter attack in Esfahan, from within Iranian territory, all of which were intercepted.

2. Israel did launch a small number of air-launched missiles into Iran at targets in Esfahan, but were all intercepted by Iranian air defense. Due to the lack of any visual evidence of explosions, it is extremely unlikely that there were any missiles, and if there were, they must've been intercepted.

3. Israel only used quadcopters in Esfahan, but dropped a missile booster without its warhead from a fighter jet inside Iraqi territory to make it seem like they fired missiles into Iran.

🔶️ The new brigades (2nd Reserve Infantry Brigade Carmeli and 679th Reserve Armored Brigade) will likely enter the Netzarim Corridor once the ongoing operation in Central Gaza is completed. After that, Nahal and 401st Brigade (the 2 brigades currently in Gaza) will rest for Rafah.

🔶️ Central Gaza Operation Update:
The IDF have advanced a few more houses, I count 33.

🔶️ In planet imagery you can see that the majority of activity is focused on Western Al-Mughraqa, which has been 60% demolished to give additional security to the Netzarim Corridor.

1. 98th Division withdraws and rests (completed)
2. Reserves are remobilized to take over the defense of the Netzarim Corridor (completed)
3. Gaza Division starts raids on uncleared pockets in North and Central Gaza (ongoing)

Next steps:
4. Evacuation of Rafah is started
5. 162nd Division withdraws and rests, is replaced with remobilized reserves

I write to you now with the heaviest of hearts.

Our brother, friend and teacher, Mehdi Vafaei (R.A.), who all of you knew as ""M.V.""... has left this world and returned to ALLAH (SWT). 

Habibi Mehdi aka Anti-Tumor, may not have ascended on the battlefield, but he was a Shahid nevertheless--for the ink of the scholar is even more precious than the blood of the martyr, and Mehdi, while he didn't see himself as such because he was too humble, was indeed a scholar; an intellectual; a philosopher; and a mouhaqqiq (researcher) of the highest order.

He was also an incomparably brilliant musician and beat-maker. Our album, ""Eternally Husseini II: Arkbound"", was in the works when Operation Al-Aqsa Flood erupted. I make a promise to him - and to all of you - that though I'm gutted and don't know how to move forward without him here... The record will come out. And it will be the flyest thing you've ever heard.

""Haji"" as well as ""Martin"" and I, along with ""Resistance Creed"", owe more to him than I can infuse into an INFINITE number of Telegram posts, let alone one, and... We're... devastated. Just... Shattered.

Shahid Mehdi was a ferocious truth-teller and didn't give one damn who he offended. The number-one enemy of all of humanity was the Jews and anyone who was too cowardly to name them, he absolutely despised. We carry that torch--in every capacity.

On a personal note... I can only say...  That I loved him as much as my own flesh and blood. And he wasn't just my friend, brother and teacher, nor just my producer... He was like my father. He was a beacon whose glimmer will never be matched by any other shine.

There will be no posting on the channel until Thursday while we all take a moment to mourn and process. We won't take any longer than that because otherwise, Shahid Mehdi would PERSONALLY Crane us! 

ALLAH yerhamak, Big Baba. King Crane! Khalas Khalkhali! You just left and we already miss you too much to describe. 💔

2024-04-15T09:23:10+00:00,-1001626824086,"— NOTE: There are signs that the Israelis and Americans are vastly overstating the amount of missiles Iran actually used

This is to make the Iron Dome, Arrow & David Sling seem more effective than they actually are, and to paint Iranian missiles as ineffective.

Today, they claimed that more than 50% of Iran's missiles failed to launch, or landed in territories outside of Israel. This is merely a weak excuse to hide the fact that they deliberately overstated the numbers.

In reality, Iran likely only launched dozens of ballistic missiles, the vast majority of which were low-cost and old models without MaRV capability, used mainly as decoys to distract Israeli defenses.

The small amount of more advanced missiles which Iran did launch, almost all of them penentrated the Israeli defenses and struck their targets in the Negev and Golan.

It will all become clearer when the IRGC releases the official details of Operation True Promise.

'What was reported in the media regarding the Islamic Republic of Iran’s response to the Zionist entity - following its aggression against its consulate and the killing of some of its people - with this bold response; This is something that really pleases the mind, and hopefully it will bear fruit soon.

Hence, we applaud this step and others like it, which we hope will preserve the nation’s forces’ prestige and presence. Evil must have a deterrent, otherwise it will become more widespread. We hope that this has caused pain to Zionism and those who support it, and we look forward to something that will break their power, repel their plots in their throats, and rid the Muslims of their evil.

While we thank God Almighty for granting success to this; We call on the entire nation to take the initiative in supporting the oppressed in Gaza and Palestine, and not to be satisfied with partial actions. This is part of the preparation of strength that God Almighty commanded in His saying: “And prepare for them what you are able.""

This is a Western way of thinking, in which one political player is the hegemon, and the other its servant, lacking any agency of its own.

The Axis of Resistance is a system of carefully funded and crafted allies, based on a common ideology and common political goals, despite the fact that there are slight differences.

Hezbollah, Ansarullah, Hamas, PIJ, Syria and the PMU all have their own domestic interests, but they work together in a wider framework to achieve common goals, in this case the resistance against Israel, which is seen as a fundamental threat to the region.

The only country that has proxies is the United States, which uses young Ukrainians as meat shields against Russia, and funds extremist groups with totally different ideologies to carry out its dirty tasks.

Israel has been using this route, which runs from the UAE through Saudi Arabia and Jordan to Israel, as a way to circumvent the Red Sea blockade in its trade with the Asian continent.

If Iran systematically cuts off Israeli-linked shipping originating in Emirati ports, Israel will effectively be shut off from any trade with Asia and would have to import everything through its Mediterranean Sea ports of Haifa & Ashdod. 

If Iran or Hezbollah then decides to strike these two ports, Israel will be completely cut off from the global trade network. This would have massive repercussions on its economy, which is heavily dependent on foreign trade.

They cannot use any electricity or power on Shabbat, but they circumvent this by loopholes, like having light switches that have a 10% chance to turn on the light, and they just keep flipping it till it turns on, so that it was 'by chance' and not intentional.

🇮🇷 Step 3: Iran strikes low-value military targets inside Israel proper, avoiding major strategic targets like ports & air fields

🇮🇱 Step 4: Israel strikes high value targets inside Iran, such as missile bases & oil refineries

🇮🇷 Step 5: Iran strikes high-value military targets across the entirety of Israel, including air fields & ports

🇮🇱 Step 6: Israel strikes Iran's nuclear program & enrichment facilities (at this point, the use of nuclear weapons cannot be ruled out), resulting in a large-scale regional war lasting for years. 

During any step in the escalation process, either of the two could decide to show restraint, stopping the escalation ladder.

They constantly share fake or unconfirmed news, just in an effort to be relevant and gain views, instead of reporting true information.

As stated before: The IRGC has no official or affiliated accounts, neither on Telegram nor on Twitter, and any such accounts should not be taken seriously.

A few days ago, this same channel, as well as various others like it, also shared news from a fake Twitter account pretending to be Iran's President Raesi, with the quote 'Zero Hour is Near'.

Please ignore such outlets. Their only purpose is hype and view-farming. Even though these channels are small, bigger channels pick up the fake info and it ends up spreading. So simply don't follow these type of media. Stick to facts.

1. Approval of the plans does not necessarily mean that it will happen any time soon, but simply that the operational plans have been approved, in case the green light is given at any point.

2. Hamas has reportedly done a new ceasefire deal proposal, and the messaging regarding action in Rafah might be Israel's way to pressure Hamas into accepting a deal, signaling that a deal may not be a possibility for much longer.

3. The United States likely wants to finish constructing its artificial port in Gaza before any Israeli invasion of Rafah takes place.

4. The IDF currently does not have enough forces concentrated near Rafah to mount an offensive in the immediate timeframe. 

5. Egypt will likely take strong diplomatic actions of protest, considering that Rafah is part of a no-go zone for the IDF according to the 1979 Camp David Accords.

2024-03-15T10:51:17+00:00,-1001626824086,"— Some quick comments regarding the slow posting these days

I know the reporting has been slow. I'm the only admin by myself, and I am quite busy in real life, and at the same time, there is not much 'news' going on in the Middle East currently.

Yes, Israel and Hamas are still at war, but every day is mostly the same. Similarly, yes, Hezbollah is at war with Israel, but we mostly see the same kind of dynamic each day. If there is something special, of course I try to report it.

Regarding Iran, it is also pretty quiet right now. I covered the elections and the recent pipeline explosions, which were noteworthy.

As for Yemen, it is still continuing its duty by targeting Israeli-linked shipping, but once again, no major changes, except that they will now target ships in the Indian Ocean.

Basically, I would rather cover events that are actually important than to report every little thing and be repetitive every day. That would lead to people being disinterested and not focused on the real developments.

At this point, covering every resistance operation, or updating the new count of Palestinian deaths in Gaza, or another drone launch from Yemen, is simply undoable because it happens so much, and because it is honestly not noteworthy anymore. I hope this makes sense to you all.

Anyways, I will be here (as I have been) if there are any major developments. And when I'm more free & find some extra admins, I'll make sure to ramp up the posting again.

Thanks for your support 💚

Iranians who do not support the Islamic Republic simply do not vote, because they have no more faith in the system. No anti-IR Iranian would take time out of his day to vote in today's election, because he considers all candidates the same anyway.

Any turnout we see today is an indicator of how many people support the Islamic Republic and still have faith in the system.

Of course, even among IR supporters, many people will stay home, considering this is only a Majlis and Expert Council election, which is not seen as extremely important by the general populace.

Generally speaking, any turnout above 45% is considered good. If 45% of people vote, this is an indication that AT LEAST 45% of people still support the Islamic Republic, not including many who will simply stay home.

Of course, based on multiple sources, including even an Israeli analysis, we know that the percentage of Islamic Republic supporters lays somewhere between 70% and 75%, but the voter turnout today will certainly be interesting to see.

'In the past few years, we have allowed Egypt to ignore parts of the Camp David accords on the basis that they were dealing with an imminent national security matter, in their case the fight against ISIS in Sinai.

This required them to send troops and military equipment to the Sinai peninsula, which is a zone that is strictly forbidden from having a military presence per the Camp David accords.

Similarly, Israel is now dealing with its own national security crisis, and we expect Egypt to be cooperative and allow the IDF into the Philadelphi Axis, so we can eliminate the remains of Hamas in Rafah.

The Camp David accords includes special provisions that specifically state that parts of the agreement may be 'violated' if the national security of either of the two countries is under imminent threat.'

• The front in southern Lebanon provides pressure, support, and participation in defeating and weakening the enemy until the aggression stops.

• Political gains touted elsewhere will not affect them or make them cease the front.

• The southern front is governed by deterrence measures and precise calculations by both sides, but there is excessive exaggeration, reaching the level of ""moral decay and obscenity.""

• Another scene of moral decay and obscenity is scaring residents of border villages through calls urging them to evacuate their homes, serving the enemy's interests.

• Attention should be paid to the psychological warfare carried out by the enemy and its allies.

• Providing information for free on social media to the Zionist enemy is unacceptable; they actively seek this information.

• Mobile phones are eavesdropping devices; thus, people are asked, especially fighters and their families in border villages, to refrain from using them to preserve lives and vital info. Mobile phones are lethal informants providing specific and deadly information.

• Israelis don't need to plant agents on roads; internet-connected cameras monitor all roads. Disconnecting these cameras from the internet is crucial to prevent further casualties, losses, and exposing the front to the enemy.

• Hezbollah monitors all developments in the region, keeping all possibilities open, but Hezbollah’s focus is on the south of Lebanon, with their eyes on Gaza.

• When aggression stops in Gaza, the firing will stop in the south. Conversely, if firing stops in Gaza and the Zionist enemy engages in any action, Hezbollah will return based on the principles and equations that were previously established. The resistance's role is to deter the enemy, and their responses will be proportionate.

• Those who threaten Hezbollah with war expansion will be met with a similar threat. Anyone who imagines that the resistance in Lebanon feels fear or confusion for even a moment is suspicious and entirely mistaken. They build on incorrect assumptions.

• Today, the resistance is more confident and has a stronger determination to confront the enemy at any level of engagement.

However, the most interesting part of the statement was a paragraph in which they said: 'Some of our brothers in the Axis, especially in the Islamic Republic (of Iran) do not know how we do Jihad, and they often object to our pressure and escalation against U.S. occupation forces in Iraq and Syria.'

Both Pro-Resistance and Anti-Resistance commentators have used this as an opportunity to claim there is now a 'rift' between Iran and Kataeb Hezbollah. However, this is NOT the case.

In fact, this was clearly a calculated statement by Kataeb Hezbollah, or a psyop as some would call it, to make it SEEM like there was a rift between Iran and its proxies, including Kataeb Hezbollah.

If they could make it seem like there is a rift between Iran and its proxies, then Iran has plausible deniability regarding the attack on U.S. troops in Jordan; Iran can simple say 'See? We didn't know it was gonna happen, in fact we told them not to do these things!'

This gives the U.S. sufficient of an excuse NOT to strike Iran or Iranian assets directly, as they can now use Kataeb Hezbollah's statement as 'evidence' that Tehran does not directly control its proxies, and therefore, should not be held directly accountable for their escalatory actions in the region.

Kataeb Hezbollah's statement helped both Iran and the United States, as neither country wants the expansion of the war.

The Palestinians will probably be forced to make so many concessions that it can't be considered a real state.

They won't be able to choose their own government, they likely won't be allowed to have a military, and they'll be dependent on Israel in almost every way.

We know that the United States and Israel have no goodwill whatsoever. And even if Palestine is recognized, and for argument's sake we assume that it would be fully sovereign, the issue is still not solved.

'Israel' will always be illegitimate and an occupation. The ENTIRE territory of the former mandate territory belongs to Palestinians, and its name is Palestine.

The establishment of an American-backed Palestine would almost certainly mean a forced Palestinian recognition of 'Israel' too. 

A so-called two-state 'solution' is nothing more than a shameful surrender to the Zionists. One Palestinian state, that's it.

Some inside the Biden administration are now thinking recognition of a Palestinian state should possibly be the first step in negotiations to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, instead of the last, a senior U.S. official said.

There are several options for U.S. action on this, including:

- Bilaterally recognizing the State of Palestine.

- Not using its veto to block the UN Security Council from admitting Palestine as a full member state.

- Encouraging other countries to recognize Palestine.

Yes, it most likely means nothing in practical terms. Anyone who thinks Israel will listen to international law, is unfamiliar with both Israel and the so-called 'international law' that the hegemonic powers claim exists.

However, one thing is significant about this. It is now UNDENIABLE that Israel is comitting a genocide. Even though it has not yet been officially proven, and it might never be (because they control the institutions), the ICC's statements from today set an important precedent.

The Zionists can no longer laugh at us and call us biased, chew us up and spit us out for using the word genocide. Because genocide is what it is. And now, the highest legal institution in the world is finally starting to openly accept this fact.

In the end, there is a war on the ground, but there is also a war of rhetoric, a war of public discourse. Up until recently, the Zionists were undoubtedly winning the media war. But thank God, times have changed. And it won't stop here.

🔶️ The United States has named the ongoing operation to target Houthi assets in Yemen “Operation Poseidon Archer,” according to two US officials.

🔶️ The named operation suggests a more organized, formal and potentially long-term approach to the operations in Yemen, where the US has been hitting Houthi infrastructure as the Iran-backed rebel group has vowed to keep targeting commercial vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. 

🔶️ The US has struck Houthi targets in Yemen seven times since carrying out its first set of attacks together with the UK military on January 11. The first wave of strikes, in which the two countries hit approximately 30 sites across Houthi-controlled Yemen, marked the beginning of Operation Poseidon Archer, one official said.

🔶️ The attacks have targeted one-way attack drones, anti-ship ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and more as the US has tried to disrupt the Houthis’ ability to fire on international shipping lanes.

🔶️ The officials emphasized that Operation Poseidon Archer is separate from Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is a defensive coalition of nations who have committed naval assets and personnel to bolstering security in the Red Sea. Some of the more than 20 nations in the coalition, including the US and UK, have repeatedly intercepted drone and missile launches from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen.

2024-01-22T11:05:43+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷 🇮🇷 Iran's Space Program: A Cover for ICBM testing?

In recent months, Iran has been launching a large amount of satellites into space, using several different SLV (Satellite Launch Vehicle) rockets.

One of these SLVs in particular, the Qaem-100, a three-stage solid-fuel rocket, looks and functions very similar to an ICBM in development, epecially after its recent modifications.

When Qaem-100 was revealed in 2022, as well as the version that was used while unsuccessfully launching the 'Nahid' satellite in 2023, it had a rounded tip. Additionally, the rocket also featured roll-control thrusters. 

In Qaem-100's new launch, which took place two days ago while sucessfully putting the 'Soraya' satellite into 750km orbit, we can see that there have been several modifications to the rocket.

Firstly, the tip of the rocket has become sharpened. This is typical in the design of long range missiles such as ICBMs. Second, the liquid-fuel roll thrusters have been omitted, to improve the missile's shelf life and decrease maintenance. Lastly, four stabilizing fins have been added, a common feature found in ICBMs.

While Iran has always been interested in expanding its space program for scientific and civilian purposes, it is likely that the launch of SLVs, in particular the Qaem-100, are a cover for testing a preliminary ICBM model. The launching of satellites is an added bonus.

This, in combination with Iran doubling its production of highly enriched U-235 uranium to 9kg a month, poses a real challenge to Israel and the United States, who now have to deal with Iran being a latent nuclear power.

Here are the following interesting bits he had to state.

1) The Arab Republic of Egypt has a great interest in preserving the capabilities of Hamas in the Gaza Strip - this is contrary to all diplomatic reports published by Israel and the U.S in where it states that Egypt wishes for the PLO to take over.

2) Egypt, in a strategy of attritional warfare, is willing to support any organization that is against Israel, including the PLO and Hamas and various other organizations, which has been taking place since 1956, and has never really ceased.

3) Egypt has no interest in developing the Gaza Strip beyond the capabilities of basic survival necessity without solving the Palestinian question - even the former president of Egypt, Morsi, had no such intentions

4) In the Lieutenant Colonel’s opinion, and based on his service as the head of an entire branch of the IDF which specialized in the studies of the capabilities of enemy forces and their culture, Egypt is seriously considering the possibility of open conflict with Israel.

5) Eli states that the Armed Forces of Egypt have started, over the last year, has dug over 60 bunkers, strategic reserves, ammunition dumps, fuel depots, and the likes, in Sinai and the west bank of the Suez Canal, the disposition of these installations and the closeness they have towards the Israeli border would insure a swift deployment of field armies, and for their resupply - Lt.Col Eli also states that Egypt has practically violated the remaining articles of Camp David by building the bunkers, fortresses, tunnels, and so on, and that the diplomatic wish-wash reports were simply made not to panic the Israeli population.

While the Pakistani government & media keeps using inflammatory language and posture, the Iranian side is trying hard to be mature and de-escalate the situation.

The amount of excitement I see on Pakistani media when an Iranian village gets hit is actually disturbing. Nationalism is a toxic disease, and makes you lose your moral compass.

2024-01-17T12:14:20+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇷/🇵🇰 I'm seeing a lot of people say ""why wouldn't Iran inform Pakistan? Why would they just do this?"":

Well, first of all, nobody actually knows if Iran informed Pakistan or not. Considering the friendly relations the two countries enjoy, it's unlikely and very unexpected that Iran would do this without informing them, especially considering the fact that Pakistan is a nuclear power and a major regional player, unlike Iraq or Syria.

It's possible that the Pakistani government was informed, but that some elements of the Pakistani military are not accepting it, especially the Pakistani Air Force, which holds considerable power in the country, and might push for retaliation, due to reasons like pride and nationalism.

In my opinion, Iran and Pakistan likely mutually agreed on launching the strikes, and the official outrage from Pakistan is orchestrated for public appeasement, and Iran knows this. The chance Pakistan will respond in this case is very small.

However, if the previous scenario is true, and some elements of the Pakistani military / government apparatus are actually angry, then they might be stupid enough to really do something militarily.

Of course, there is also the third (and least likely) scenario, which is that Iran didn't inform Pakistan. If this turns out to be the case, it was definitely because of security considerations. 

Sadly, Pakistan and the ISI have been tacitly supporting terrorist groups like Jaish Ul-Adl in Iran for years. Iran might've wanted to avoid the Pakistani government alerting the groups before the strikes.

For now, neither Iran nor the IRGC has yet released an official statement regarding the Pakistan strikes. Until then, it's all just speculation.

Having said that, Iran has the full right and responsibility to act decisively against terrorist groups both within and outside its borders.

Yes, it's a step up in the escalation ladder, and Hezbollah mentioned it was merely an 'initial response'. I hope this is true, because although it's an important strategic target, it is not proportionate to Al-Arouri's assassination in Beirut.

What I think is going to happen, is that instead of opting for one large response, Hezbollah is choosing to gradually shift the gear of battle into a new stage, making it clear that targeting strategic assets and important bases will now become a regular occurence, instead of just targeting surveillance equipment, troop concentrations and tanks.

For Hezbollah it might be more advantageous if they can keep the back-and-forth battles going, striking increasingly important targets, while staying just beneath the threshold that would provoke a full-scale war from the Israelis.

If this is the type of response Hezbollah is choosing, then I expect them to strike more strategic assets in the coming days, like they did today. That would be a proportionate response, as it would be a 'continuous' gear shift, not a one-off incident. It would change the dimension of the war as a whole.

However, if this was all, then I think it is fair to say this a lackluster response to the killing of Al-Arouri, which was much more significant and symbolic. We will see in the next few days what will happen.

🔶️ Biden administration officials are drawing up plans for the U.S. to respond to what they’re increasingly concerned could expand from a war in Gaza to a wider, protracted regional conflict.

🔶️ Four officials familiar with the matter, including a senior administration official, described internal conversations about scenarios that could potentially draw the U.S. into another Middle East war. All were granted anonymity to speak about sensitive, ongoing national security discussions.

🔶️ The military is drafting plans to hit back at Iran-backed Houthi militants who have been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea, according to three U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the discussions. That includes striking Houthi targets in Yemen, according to one of the officials, an option the military has previously presented.

🔶️ Intelligence officials, meanwhile, are coming up with ways to anticipate and fend off possible attacks on the U.S. by Iranian-backed forces in Iraq and Syria, according to one of the officials. They are also working to determine where the Houthi militants may strike next.

🔶️ “Although the U.S. has been trying to avoid having the war in Gaza from turning into a regional one, ultimately that decision is not entirely up to us,” said Mick Mulroy, a former Marine, CIA officer and Pentagon official under Trump. “The signs are blinking red for this to erupt into a regional war.”

There are some very suspicious signs that not ISIS, but rather a different entity wrote today's statement. They are the following:

1. ISIS used the word 'Iran' in its official statement, which is highly unusual. ISIS always uses Islamic rhetoric, as they do not believe in the concept of nation states. In past attacks on Iran, they called it 'Fars Province' or 'Khorasan Province' as part of the Islamic Caliphate, but never 'Iran'.

2. ISIS published the photos of the two alleged suicide bombers with their faces blurred. This is highly unusual; previous suicide bombers never had their faces blurred. Additionally, there is no practical reason for the images to be blurred, which is usually done to avoid identification leading to their arrest. This is not an active risk, because the suicide bombers are already dead and their bodies in pieces.

3. ISIS took responsibility approximately 30 hours after the bombings. This is unusual, as the terrorist group usually issues a statement on the same day of the attack, most of the times even immediately after.

'In a blatant violation of pure blood, a transgression against the security and sovereignty of Iraq, and an unacceptable act of terrorism, the occupying American forces targeted the Deputy Commander of Baghdad Belt Operations, the martyr Abu Taqwa Al-Saeedi, and his companion, the martyr Abu Sajjad, one of the leaders of the 12th Brigade in the Hashd al-Shaabi, and wounded a number of soldiers with a drone strike. 

It targeted the headquarters of the Hashd al-Shaabi in the heart of the capital, Baghdad. The American forces that committed this terrorist crime bear full responsibility for violating Iraqi sovereignty and attacking our Mujahideen brothers in the Hashd al-Shaabi. 

While we affirm that statements and condemnations are no longer useful in light of the repeated crimes and violations, we call on the Iraqi government to take decisive steps to end the presence of the so-called international coalition in Iraq, remove all occupying foreign forces as quickly as possible, and cut off the pretexts and excuses that allow the Americans to prolong their presence on our land and in our skies.

Several hours ago, he was assassinated in his car by a hellfire missile launched from a U.S. drone. The Iraqi PMU holds America directly responsible.

He was likely assassinated because the U.S. considers him responsible for the attacks by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq against U.S. targets the past months.

'In the name of God. The evil and criminal enemies of the Iranian nation once again created a disaster and martyred a large number of our dear people in Kerman, in the fragrant atmosphere of the martyrs cemetery.

The nation of Iran is grieving and many families mourn the death of their loved ones. The hard-hearted criminals could not tolerate the love and enthusiasm of the people to visit the shrine of their great commander Qassem Soleimani. 

Let them know that the soldiers of the pure Soleimani will not tolerate their vileness and crime. Both the hands stained with the blood of innocents and the corrupt and mischievous brains that led them to this error, will be the definite target of repression and just punishment from now on. Let them know that this disaster will have a hard response, God willing.

I sympathize with the bereaved families and pray for their patience and consolation from the Almighty God. The pure souls of the martyrs, God willing, are the guests of the lady of two worlds and the mother of the martyrs, the pure Lady Fatima, peace be upon her. I sympathize with the injured and pray for their healing.'

'We mourn for our Arab and Islamic community, we mourn for free Palestine and its great resistance and its proud people, and for the free people and the mujahideen everywhere. The great mujahideen leader and deputy head of the political bureau of the Hamas movement, Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri, was martyred with a number of his fellow mujahideen, on the road to Jerusalem.

We extend our condolences to our brothers in Hamas, the brave mujahideen of the Izz al-Din al-Qassam Brigades, the people of steadfast Gaza, Holy Jerusalem, the opressed West Bank, and all factions and movements of resistance and jihad in Palestine. 

God Almighty has concluded the career of this great leader with the highest medal of honor. Dignity and attaining martyrdom is what he had always sought, wished for, and worked for with his Mujahideen brothers: resistance and jihad, until victory or martyrdom.

The criminal enemy, which after ninety days of crimes against humanity, murder and destruction, was unable to subjugate Gaza, Khan Yunis, the Jabaliya camp and the rest of the honourable cities, camps and villages, is resorting to a policy of assassinations and physical liquidation of everyone who worked, planned, carried out or supported the heroic Al-Aqsa Flood operation and contributed. In defense of the oppressed people of Palestine, today’s crime is a continuation of the crime of assassinating commander Sayyed Razi Al-Musawi in another arena of action and a new front of combat, and this heinous crime will only increase the intensity of the resistance in Palestine, Lebanon, Yemen, Syria, Iran, and Iraq with faith in their cause, with firm commitment and determination to continue the path of resistance and jihad until victory and liberation. ‏
‏
We consider the crime of assassinating Sheikh Saleh Al-Arouri and his fellow martyrs in the heart of the southern suburbs of Beirut to be a serious assault on Lebanon, its people, its security, sovereignty, and resistance, and the highly symbolic and significant political and security messages it contains, and a dangerous development in the course of the war between the enemy and the axis of resistance, and we in Hezbollah affirm that this crime will never pass without response and punishment, and that our pledge is steadfast, proud, and faithful to its principles and commitments that it has made to itself, its hand is on the trigger, and its resistors are in the highest levels of readiness and preparedness, and this is a memorable day for what follows. For the next days, great patience and beautiful patience, and God is the one who helps, and victory, God Almighty willing, is very near.

2023-12-31T17:10:59+00:00,-1001626824086,"⚓️ 🇺🇸 🇾🇪 The U.S. Navy is Unprepared for a Prolonged War with Yemen pt2

🔶️ Each of the Aegis missiles, as I noted in my previous post, cost at least $500,000 dollars. A retired U.S. DOD official told me today that the actual cost is $2 million dollars. If Yemen opts to use drone swarms to saturate the battle space around a carrier, then the United States will firing very expensive missiles to destroy relatively inexpensive drones. This brings up another critical vulnerability — the U.S. only has a limited supply of these air defense missiles and does not have the industrial capability in place and operating to produce new ones rapidly to make up the deficit.

🔶️ Then there is the problem of finding the mobile missile platforms in Yemen. Remember the problems the United States had in Iraq in 1991 trying to find and destroy SCUD missile launch systems? While ISR systems are better today, there is still no guarantee of being able to locate and destroy in a timely manner. The Yemenis have more than 8 years experience dealing with U.S. ISR and U.S. drone attacks. On November 9th the Yemenis shot down a MQ-9 Reaper drone. That baby costs a little more than $30 million dollars.

🔶️ Here is the bottomline. The United States flotilla, along with its allies, can do some damage to Yemen but are unlikely to achieve a decisive victory. Yemen, for its part, can inflict some serious damage to some of the ships — maybe even sink one or two — and by doing so, score a moral victory that will fuel doubts about America’s naval capabilities and staying power. Perhaps this explains why the U.S. has been so slow to respond to the attacks launched by Yemen.

2023-12-31T17:10:59+00:00,-1001626824086,"⚓️ 🇺🇸 🇾🇪 The U.S. Navy is Unprepared for a Prolonged War with Yemen pt1

🔶️ Tiny Yemen has surprised the West with its tenacity and ferocity in attacking ships trying to ferry containers and fuel to Israel.

🔶️ Before explaining the risks, you must understand that the U.S. Navy is configured currently as a “Forward-Based Navy” and is not an “Expeditionary Navy.” Anthony Cowden, writing for the Center for International Maritime Security in September, examined this issue in his article, REBALANCE THE FLEET TOWARD BEING A TRULY EXPEDITIONARY NAVY.

🔶️ Due to the unique geographical position of the U.S., the Navy has the luxury of defending the nation’s interests “over there.” Since World War II, it developed and maintained a navy that was able to project power overseas; to reconstitute its combat power while still at sea or at least far from national shores; and continuously maintain proximity to competitors. This expeditionary character minimized the dependence of the fleet on shore-based and homeland-based infrastructure to sustain operations, allowing the fleet to be more logistically self-sufficient at sea.

🔶️ However, late in the Cold War, the U.S. Navy started to diminish its expeditionary capability, and became more reliant on allied and friendly bases. A key development was subtle but consequential – the vertical launch system (VLS) for the surface fleet’s primary anti-air, anti-submarine, and land-attack weapons. While a very capable system, reloading VLS at sea was problematic and soon abandoned. While an aircraft carrier can be rearmed at sea, surface warships cannot, which constrains the ability of carrier strike groups to sustain forward operations without taking frequent trips back to fixed infrastructure. The Navy is revisiting the issue of reloading VLS at sea, and those efforts should be reinforced.

🔶️ The next step the Navy took away from an expeditionary capability was in the 1990s, when it decommissioned most of the submarine tenders (AS), all of the repair ships (AR), and destroyer tenders (AD), and moved away from Sailor-manned Shore Intermediate Maintenance Centers (SIMA). Not only did this eliminate the ability to conduct intermediate maintenance “over there,” but it destroyed the progression of apprentice-to-journeyman-to-master technician that made the U.S. Navy Sailor one of the premier maintenance resources in the military world. Combat search and rescue, salvage, and battle damage repair are other areas in which the U.S. Navy no longer has sufficient capability for sustaining expeditionary operations.

🔶️ Each U.S. destroyer carries an estimated 90 missiles (perhaps a few more). Their primary mission is to protect the U.S. aircraft carrier they are shielding. What happens when Yemen fires 100 drones/rockets/missiles at a U.S. carrier? The U.S. destroyer, or multiple destroyers will fire their missiles to defeat the threat. Great. Mission accomplished! Only one little problem, as described in the preceding quote — the U.S. Navy got rid of the ship tenders, i.e. those vessels capable of resupplying destroyers with new missiles to replace the expended rounds. In order to reload, that destroyer must sail to the nearest friendly port where the U.S. has stockpiled missiles for resupply.

🔶️ If the destroyer must sail away then the U.S. carrier must follow. It cannot just sit out in the ocean without its defensive screen of ships. The staying power of a U.S. fleet in a combat zone, like Yemen, is a function of how many missiles the Yemenis fire at the U.S. ships.

Yes, Iran wants revenge, and it will avenge, but Iran has rarely openly responded to any such assassinations in the past. The responses have mostly remained unpublicized.

Just a few weeks ago two senior IRGC generals were killed in Syria, and Iran did not escalate or avenge them openly, despite people saying they would.

Iran seeks its revenge in the shadows. There will suddenly be a fire at some chemical plant in Haifa, or a senior IDF commander will be in a suspicious car crash, or Benny Gantz' secretary will turn out to be an Iranian spy. 

This is how it's been, and how it will be. Iran rarely responds publicly unless the enemy publicly announces the assassination, such as with Soleimani.

Honestly, it shows to me they were desperate and panicking. On October 11th, Hamas fighters were still holding onto their positions inside Israeli settlements, and had not yet been expelled into Gaza.

Perhaps if Hezbollah had struck at the same time, Israel would've been overwhelmed, since they couldn't have handled two fronts simultaneously, especially since Hamas was still fresh.

I believe if there were to be war with Hezbollah, it would have been much more favourable earlier rather than now, considering that Hamas is now somewhat exhausted, but I'm no military tactician.

If it's really true that Hezbollah sent suicide drones at Karish gasfield (with the aim of destroying it), surely they know that this would've provoked a full scale war, or at the very least a significant escalation.

So, there are two options:
1. Hezbollah knows the repercussions and is actively trying to escalate with Israel, perhaps even to a full scale war - or
2. It didn't happen, and it's an Israeli psyop.

Or an alternative option (more unlikely): Hezbollah thinks Israel is bluffing regarding their appetite for a war, and thinks it could actually target vital infrastructure like gasfields without provoking such a war.

Now, nobody really knows Hezbollah's plan at this point, but it would be a very bold move if the story turns out to be true.

But come on, Trumpists are legitimately some of the dumbest people ever. They constantly call Democrats 'brainwashed' by the fake news media, but they're literally the exact same on the opposite side of the spectrum.

Anything Biden says, Trump will simply oppose it and his supporters will say 'omg so true!' and start sperging about some random stories like how Biden is actually a corrupt child-sacrificing Ukrainian-backed maffia boss with a coke-addicted son. Then the Democrats will shout that Trump is secretly a fascist dictator who will suspend the constitution and put Mexicans in Auschwitz together with the trannies.

My point is, it's just a bullshit political game where both parties pretend to disagree. Unless it's about Israel of course, that's a subject that both parties interestingly never disagree on, and I implore you to question why that is.

Anyways, if you want to vote for Trump because he's the lesser of two evils and is slightly less satanic and degenerate than Biden on social issues for example, then I get it, but you cannot legitimately support that guy and actually believe he's different from the rest of the corrupt clique, same goes for Biden.

This comes after the Egyptian Defense Minister two days ago stated that ""a severe military escalation in the region"" would occur if the Palestinians were evicted from Gaza.

Egypt has, apparently, so far, rejected the following.

1) a 10 billion US dollar, interest-free loan from the IMF, to accept the refugees

2) A ""Massive"" amount of Egyptian debt being forgiven

3) Several billions of Euros from the EU to accept Palestinians as refugees.

All Egyptian officials consistently stated that the issue of Gaza will not be solved on the expense of Egypt, and that the mass eviction of Palestinians from Gaza will be against a direct understanding that were laid on paper for over 70 years, not even the Israelis had the courage to evict Palestinians from Gaza during the 1967-1979 period when they had total control of the enclave and Sinai.

Activists have leaked a video showing IDF soldiers receiving the cargo and celebrating, the cargo is from Turkey, has Turkish written on it, and so on.

There is no official reaction towards this from mainstream Turkish outlets or officials.

This action must be condemned in the harshest terms, Turkey is quite literally aiding genocide. They are all talk, their support for Palestine is only superficial.

Now, this is certainly an interesting find, and it is not untrue that most Hamas and especially PIJ members support Iran ideologically, many have even converted to Shiism and some have gone as far as founding their own Shi'ite factions in Gaza, like the Sabereen movement.

But it is more likely that this is an Israeli setup, to take credit away from the Palestinian resistance and to pin all its success and blame on Iran, so that Israel can make Iran the scapegoat for what happened on October 7th.

In fact, it was a fully domestic Palestinian operation, and they did not inform Iran or Hezbollah in order to maintain total operational secrecy, as admitted by Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah himself.

At this point, it looks to me like escalation in the North is inevitable, and that Hezbollah is actively provoking Israel into a disproportionate response.

Hezbollah knows that it would be hugely in their favor if Israel were perceived as the agressor, especially domestically, due to the support for a war in Lebanon being at an all time low as a result of the economic crisis.

If Hezbollah can manage to spin the situation in such a way that the 'international community' and more importantly the Lebanese political scene sees Israel as the initiator of the upcoming war, then Hezbollah might have just enough domestic support to get through the war without major civil and sectarian unrest.

High-ranking Lebanese officials have so far stated that Hezbollah is acting in 'patriotic interests' and 'defense of their homeland', and the organization hopes that it can keep this perception going for as long as possible, so that in case of a war, Hezbollah will not be blamed as the instigator.

Almog Boker, a Zionist journalist working for Channel 13 wrote the following on X:

'The IDF cautiously assesses that the disintegration of Hamas has begun.
According to military sources, the Al-Qassam brigade in the northern Gaza Strip operates as a collection of activists who each initiate their own operations, and the ability of Hamas to conduct campaigns as an organized military organization in northern Gaza is severely challenged.

The damage to Hamas in northern Gaza can be seen by the dramatic decrease in the volume of launches from this area, and it is assumed that this decrease is due to both the damage to the systems themselves, as well as the damage to Hamas' command and control. However, Hamas operatives are not giving up.'

Gaza and the war against Israel is not just in Hezbollah's interest because of 'solidarity with the Palestinian cause'. In fact, as Nasrallah said, the victory of Hamas is a vital interest for Lebanon.

If Gaza comes under Israeli occupation, they know that Israel will be able to focus attention & its forces and set its sight on Lebanon, which will undoubtedly be next.

Gaza is the last line of defense for Hezbollah, so they won't let it fail."

• South of Gaza City, ongoing clashes in the Tal al-Hawa area. The IOF claims to have secured the coastline, but it’s merely a confrontation zone, not secured.

• No advancements in Beit Hanoun

– Extremely heavy airstrikes on Gaza, journalists called them 'unprecedented' and possibly the worst since October 7th.

– The Royal Jordanian Air Force dropped medical aid packages to the Jordanian field hospital in Gaza.

– The death toll in Gaza has officially surpassed 10.000.

– Notably, Hamas carried out two large scale rocket barrages on Tel Aviv and other cities in central Israel, showing that they still have the capability to carry out attacks. 

– Two Iron Dome missiles misfired and struck Israeli streets in Tel Aviv.

— Ground situation in Gaza: 

– To the north of Beit Hanoun, the IDF retreated towards the border fence. To the north-east of Beit Lahia, Israel holds most of the surrounding farmlands on the outskirts of the city, and has begun entering the urban area, where heavy clashes are taking place.

– After entering from the As-Siafa area in the north-west of the Gaza strip, the IDF has advanced along the coastline until the Al-Shati camp. The strip they control is about 1km wide from the shore measured inland, and about 7.5km deep from As-Siafa to Al-Shati camp.

– After entering the middle of Gaza from the east through Juhor Al-Dik, the IDF advanced in the north of Wadi Gaza past Al-Mughraqa, reaching Al-Rashid street on the coastline and establishing control over it, effectively cutting off the last road connecting the north to the south. Clashes are currently ongoing in the southern outskirts of Gaza City, mostly in the neighbourhood of Wahsh and the area surrounding Salah Al-Deen road.

— Outside of Gaza:

– Hezbollah targeted several settlements across the Lebanese border with ATGMs, confirming casualties. As a response to the killing of 4 Lebanese civilians, they shelled the Israeli town of Kiryat Shmona with 122mm 'Grad' (Katyusha) rockets, causing direct impacts. The Iron Dome failed to intercept most of these rockets. Hezbollah reportedly also downed an Israeli UAV, although this has not been confirmed. Additionally, Hezbollah announced 3 more martyrs, making the total 61 since October 7th.

– Israel carried out airstrikes and artillery shelling of South Lebanon as a response to these attacks.

– U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken visited Baghdad to meet with Iraqi PM Mohammad Shia Al-Sudani. He left for Ankara after a few hours.

– The Islamic Resistance in Iraq targeted the U.S. base in Tal Baidar in Syria's Hasakah province with two suicide drones, as well as the U.S. base in Erbil Intl. Airport.

It is a primitive rocket which carries a large warhead, which saw widescale use in the Syrian civil war due to its simplicity and destructiveness.

The rocket is unguided and not very accurate, but Hezbollah seems to use it very effectively. Keep in mind, Hezbollah has way more advanced missiles than this. This is one of their lowest tiers in terms of tech.

2023-11-03T15:13:14+00:00,-1001626824086,"— Some people say Hezbollah must intervene to 'stop the bloodshed'

Dear people, what do you think would happen if Hezbollah declared war? Bloodshed would only increase, but this time it will be Beirut instead of Gaza.

Hezbollah will enter the war when it is necessary to do so to achieve victory. Currently, despite what people say, Hamas is in a good position, and it looks like Israel will not accomplish their objectives.

If Hamas is victorious without Hezbollah's full-scale intervention, and Israel is unable to achieve their objectives, this is even better. This would certainly be the best scenario for the resistance. It means Gaza has become independent and self-sufficient in its resistance.

If Hamas can manage to exert a strategic and military defeat on Israel, besides the political defeat they have already inflicted, while at the same time preserving the power of Hezbollah, this is the best case scenario.

I see people WANTING Hezbollah to join. Not because it would actually help or be beneficial for Palestine in a practical sense, but simply because they get an adrenaline rush from seeing the expansion of war.

The stakes are extremely high, and Hezbollah getting involved would mean the US bombing of Lebanon, and a widescale conflict, which after it, we do not know if we will see Palestine be victorious.

Hezbollah will not intervene just for the sake of intervention, but rather only when it has a practical and realistic reason to do so.

Gaza and Palestine are currently on the winning end, despite their large sacrifices, so there is no point in betting extra money in the poker game you're already winning.

There is no reason to take a huge risk when you are currently on the side of victory.

'In the name of God, the most Merciful, the most Gracious. 

To our mujahideen brothers of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon.

Your message and words have reached us, and you are, by God, and as you said, most blessed brothers to us in jihad and resistance on the path of Al-Quds.

We send you our response from the heart of Palestine, from the ruins and the rubble, from the smokey dust of battle with this defeated enemy, while we are surrounded with the souls of our martyred families, children, women and elderly.

Our brothers, we have destroyed and decimated this defeated army, we have seen and shown the entire world how feeble they are, weaker than a spider's web, as they tried to avoid facing us man to man and resorted instead to committing massacres and genocide upon our people and families.

We are, today, greater in power and resilience, and stronger in faith and certainty that victory walks with us. In these very moments, our fighters are in face-to-face combat with the tanks and vehicles of the agressor, in a showdown that has grayed the hairs on the heads of the officers and soldiers of the enemy, and frozen the blood in their veins as they flee from our fighters who eagerly await martyrdom.

We have shown this enemy exactly what we are capable of, in what they call 'the Gaza Envelope', where we met them face to face, and they are now deterred such that when they see us approach, they turn their backs and flee.

Our beloved brothers, we have seen your actions and jihad, and the blood of your martyrs which has become one with the blood of ours. And we see also the fear and cowardice and horror that your fight instills in the enemy. You have always been and you will always be the masters of battle.

We conclude our response by saying that we and you are upon an assured promise of victory in this battle, and we firmly believe that this is the beginning of the demise of the Zionist entity.

We ask God to grant us prayer soon in the blessed Al-Aqsa mosque, our calls and Takbirs jubilant with the joy of the Victory of God - and for God this is not difficult in the slightest.

And this is our jihad: victory or martyrdom.

Your brothers, the mujahideen of the Palestinian Resistance.'"

– Heavy airstrikes in the Gaza strip. Several dozens of wounded Palestinian civilians were transported to Egypt through the Rafah crossing for emergency care.

– Sporadic rocket barrages from Gaza into surrounding Israeli settlements.

Ground situation in Gaza: 

– Israeli armor and mechanized infantry units have advanced from As-Siafa in the northwest, and have reached the Salah Khalaf street 2.5km deep into the Gaza envelope, establishing control over a narrow strip of land along Gaza's north-western beach area on the outskirts of Gaza City. 

– In the north of the Wadi Gaza area, which is located in the middle of the strip and seperates northern Gaza from southern Gaza, Israeli forces have advanced to Dahdouh street on the southern outskirts of Gaza City just north of Al-Mughraqa, after penentrating from the east. They are now 1km away from Al-Rashid street near the beach, which is the last road connecting Gaza City to Khan Younis and the rest of southern Gaza. The Israelis aim to capture this road as soon as possible. 

– In the north and northeast, Israeli forces control the farmland near the outskirts of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun. Today, they made their first limited entry into the urban environment of Beit Hanoun, establishing control over a few residential blocks. 

– From the east, Israeli forces advanced into Jabalia Camp in a very narrow spearhead, reaching quite deep into the center of Jabalia, up to the Jabalia Elementary School for Boys. While this entry is deep, it is like a needle; sharp but narrow. If the IDF gets cut off in this area, they will have to deal with an encirclement.

– According to official Israeli statistics, 16 IDF soldiers were killed during fighting in Gaza today. However, Al-Qassam claims many more Israeli casualties. They also released a video showing the targeting of IDF troops with a grenade dropped from a quadcopter.

Outside of Gaza:

– Yemen's Ansarullah, also known as the Houthis, carried out two attacks against Israel today using drones, ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. Their military spokesman Yahya Saree officially claimed responsibility for the first time, and vowed to continue and increase attacks on Israel in support of Palestine.

– The Islamic Resistance in Iraq targeted the U.S. base in Al-Tanf, Syria, with two suicide drones in the early morning. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq also reportedly held an important meeting involving different factions, which resulted in a decision to expel all foreign military forces from Iraq by any means necessary.

– Hezbollah carried out several attacks on IDF sites across the border. They issued a statement in support of the resistance in Palestine and Gaza, and said their finger is on the trigger. At night, Hezbollah announced the downing of an armed Israeli UAV above Al-Malikiyah with a surface-to-air missile.

– As a response to attacks by Hezbollah, the IDF shelled South Lebanon with artillery and carried out targeted drone strikes against Hezbollah positions.

– Mortar fire from Syria struck empty agricultural lands in the Israeli occupied Golan Heights.

– The Wall Street Journal, citing the South Korean intelligence services, claims that Kim Jong Un instructed the government of the DPRK to start supporting Palestine and other resistance factions with weapons.

– Heavy airstrikes in the Gaza strip. The IAF bombed a large gathering of civilians in the Al-Jabaliya Refugee Camp, resulting in possibly hundreds of deaths. Humanitarian situation continues to deteriorate, but Egyptian aid is expected soon.

– Throughout the day, Hamas carried out at least 5 different rocket barrages into Israel, including Tel Aviv. Settlements located close to Gaza such as Ashkelon and Sderot have been registering more direct impacts due to a shortage of Tamer missiles for the Iron Dome, which forces Israel to focus its defenses on major population centers, considering there are not enough stockpiles to defend all of Israel at this point.

– Ground situation in Gaza: Israeli forces control the beach area of As-Siafa in the north-west of the strip, as well as most of the farmland on the outskirts of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun in the north and north-east. Today, the IDF penentrated into the middle of Gaza by entering Wadi Gaza with armored units from the east. As a result, they established control over Salah Al-Deen road, the main road connecting Gaza City to the rest of the Gaza strip. The IDF is trying to push west through the middle of Wadi Gaza to capture Al-Rashid street, the last route that still connects the north of Gaza to the south.

– According to the available information, the IDF has suffered a considerable amount of casualties in Gaza so far. Hamas claims that the Al-Qassam brigades have destroyed 22 IDF vehicles until now, and some sources estimate that a few dozen Israeli soldiers have been killed, although no official figures are available except what the IDF releases. Most of the casualties occured while penentrating Gaza from the middle of Wadi Gaza, to capture the Salah Al-Deen road. 

– The Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun outskirts have not offered much resistance, because the area consists mostly of farmland and is not suitable for fighting a superior enemy, as opposed to an urban environment.

– Yemen's Ansarullah (Houthis) carried out four attacks on southern Israel with ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones. Most of these were intercepted above Eilat, and at least one missile fell in Jordan. The military spokesman of Ansarullah vowed to increase attacks against Israel as long as the agression on Gaza continues.

– Hezbollah targeted the IDF in the settlements of Al-Jardah, Branit Barracks, Al-Marj, and Al-Khazzan Hill with ATGMs, leading to several confirmed casualties and the destruction of a Merkava tank with its crew inside.

– The IDF shelled South Lebanon and carried out airstrikes against Hezbollah targets.

2023-10-31T18:20:34+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇱🇧 Hezbollah: The Game Plan

Everyone who has been following the war since the 7th of October knows that all parties involved are anxiously awaiting the next move from resistance-axis factions, first and foremost Hezbollah.

Hezbollah, who pushed Israel out of Lebanon in the 80's and defended the South against another attempted occupation in 2006, is a far more potent and capable enemy to the Israeli military than Hamas or the PIJ will ever be.

Since the beginning of the war, unofficial statements and media reports have been circulating, claiming that an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza would be considered as a red line for Hezbollah. 

Despite these statements being unofficial, many of you have wondered, when will Hezbollah really get involved?

Since October 8th, Hezbollah has attacked IDF positions across the Lebanese border every single day, with no exceptions. Approximately 50 martyrs have been announced, and we can only wonder about the number of Israeli casualties. Besides the deaths, many IDF vehicles and tanks have been destroyed.

However, there are clues that something else is being prepared for. Something bigger. Something unprecedented.

Each day for the past 24 days, Hezbollah has consistently and sucessfully been targeting Israeli surveillance & observation equipment on the Lebanese border.

Dozens of radar stations, night vision cameras, infrared sensors, long range communication towers, telescopes and antennas have all been destroyed by the Lebanese group during the past few weeks. 

These operations, which disabled most of the IDFs observation network, have practically blinded the Israelis in the north, especially in Metula and the surrounding settlements. One can only start to wonder why Hezbollah would have put so much emphasis on this modus-operandi, instead of just opting for killing soldiers or destroying tanks. 

Now that the IDF has comitted most of its forces to urban combat operations in Gaza, a unique opportunity is opening up in the north. One that might shape the future of the region. Hezbollah knows this, and has been waiting for this moment for 17 years.

The north is now a total blind spot, and based on the available information, it is very possible that the main event is yet to come. 

All we can do is wait for Nasrallah's speech on Friday, but there might be some surprises in store. All the signs are there.

– Sporadic small-scale rocket attacks from the Gaza strip into Israeli settlements.

– Large amounts of Israeli tanks and mechanized infantry units are inside northern Gaza since last friday, having fully secured the area of As-Siafa near the sea, which constitutes an incursion of about 1.5km deep at the furthest point. No additional progress was made during the course of today, despite continuous clashes.

– On the Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun outskirts, the IDF has not made any further advancements since yesterday either, having so far secured an incursion of about 300 meters into the strip.

– Small scale rocket attacks took place on settlements in the Galilee, with a confirmed impact in Kiryat Shmona, causing a fire. The attacks were claimed by the Sunni-Islamist movement 'Jamaa Islamiyya' in Lebanon, specifically its armed wing, the Al-Fajr forces.

– Hezbollah targeted IDF troops, equipment and vehicles in the settlements of Misgav, Al-Samaqah, Al-Malikiyah, Birkat Risha and Ramia with ATGMs and other weaponry, inflicting casualties and materiel losses. They announced one martyr, making the total amount now 48.

– IDF Spokesman Hagari repeated that Northern Gaza residents should immediately relocate South while they still can, and warned that 'intense hostilities' will follow.

– Sporadic rocket attacks from Gaza into central and Southern Israel, but nothing major. Most Israeli settlements near Gaza have been completely evacuated at this point, so casualties are unlikely.

– Since last night, IDF tanks and mechanized infantry units have reportedly managed to advance about 100-200 meters into North and North-Eastern Gaza on the outskirts of Beit Lahia and Beit Hanoun, and have taken operational control of the As-Siafa area in the North-West. All reliable reports indicate that resistance is harsh, with Al-Qassam claiming that one of their fighters has single-handedly destroyed three IDF vehicles. 

– Hezbollah targeted IDF sites in Risha, Al-Jardah, Al-Abad, Al-Marj, Abu Dajjaj and Zarit with ATGMs, striking IDF troops and destroying enemy observation & surveillance equipment.

– As usual, the IDF shelled South Lebanon with artillery, and the IAF carried out targeted drone strikes against Hezbollah infrastructure.

– Netanyahu gave a speech, calling this war 'Israel's second war of independence'. He also said that the 'second stage of the war' has now begun, with a focus on destroying Hamas' military capabilities.

– No actions involving Yemen or Iraq were recorded today. There are some reports that U.S. forces at the Al-Omar oil field in Syria came under attack, but no group has officially claimed responsibility so far.

– According to sources, the IDF managed to enter up to 100 meters deep into the Gaza strip with tank columns and mechanized infantry elements. Sources talk about 'thousands' of soldiers as of now.

– As a result of harsh resistance, the IDF forces, which are located to the North and East of Beit Hanoun and the North of Beit Lahia erected dirt barriers around their perimiters and dug in for the night, facing small arms fire and anti-tank fire until this very moment.

– According to pro-Israeli claims, the IDF suffered no casualties. However, preliminary data suggests otherwise, although no exact number can be mentioned. With the amount of gunfire and explosions heard in live feeds near the incursion sites, it is not unlikely that there could be as many as a few dozen casualties and several destroyed tanks, as claimed by pro-Palestinian sources close to Hamas and the PIJ.

– Today marked the heaviest bombing on Gaza since the beginning of the war. Artillery was also used starting in the evening. Besides the horrible humanitarian situation, all major communication channels have now been cut, and there is a total internet and mobile blackout in the Gaza strip.

– Very early in the morning of October 27th, U.S. F-16 fighter jets struck IRGC-affiliated targets in Al-Bukamal, Syria, according to the Pentagon.

– Several unidentified drones have crashed in Egypt, in the cities of Taba and Suweida. Presumably, the drones were launched by the Houthis from Yemen and flew over the Red Sea towards Israel, where the IAF intercepted them, causing the debris to fall in Egyptian territory.

– Hezbollah attacked IDF positions across the border in the settlements of Al-Sadh, Misgav Am, Ruwaysat Al-Alam, Samaqah, Zibdin and others, killing several enemy soldiers and destroying surveillance and communications equipment. 

– Israel responded by shelling South Lebanon as usual. However, the northern front was still very quiet compared to what we're used to seeing these days.

– Israel reportedly intercepted several projectiles fired from Syria into the occupied Golan Heights, and the IDF responded by shelling the launch sites.

– The Islamic Resistance in Iraq targeted the Ayn Al-Assad base in Iraq, the Al-Tanf base in Syria, and possibly also the Kharab Al-Jir and Al-Omar bases in Syria, according to reports. As of now, they have only officially claimed the attack on Ayn Al-Assad and Al-Tanf.

– The IDF announced that they would 'expand ground operations in Gaza tonight', leading to widescale reporting and speculation that the ground offensive into Gaza has officially started. 

– A few hours after the IDF statement, Israeli tanks crossed into Gaza and clashes near Beit Hanoun were reported. However, due to the total media blackout in Gaza, it is impossible to accurately assess the extent of the Israeli incursion, and whether the long anticipated full-scale ground offensive has really begun.

– Large pro-Hamas rallies took place in many cities in the West Bank including Jenin, Nablus and Jerusalem.

– Speculation about the ground offensive continues into the night, as Israeli outlets mostly try to downplay the current incursion, while U.S. sources, amongst others, claim that tonight does in fact constitute the beginning of a large scale ground offensive. Some sources are reporting the invasion might happen in phases, rather than in one swift motion, and are saying that this could have been the beginning of the first phase.

It's easy to distinguish when the Israeli officer was planting words in their mouth to pass the narrative, and when the Hamas soldiers were telling the truth.

Out of it all, it's clear that Hamas soldiers were give these orders:

1- To take over Israeli army bases and kill any resisting soldier. Kidnap those who surrender back to Gaza.

2- Kill any combat age Israeli male

3- Spare all elderly (male & female), women and children. Kidnap if possible.

4- Some were given order to shelter inside Israeli settlements, while others inside IDF bases

But note that:

1- They acknowledge killing some elderly civilians due to the element of being surprised, while moving from house to house.

2- They acknowledge some members that overstepped the boundaries set by their leadership

However their actions in 7 October, mostly falls under a justifiable response to the Israeli occupation of Palestine and the nature of the Israeli settlers and settlements."

Well, the bombings did continue, and they have not executed anyone as far as I am aware. But then again, some sources say that almost 50 Israelis died in IAF airstrikes on Gaza so far, so they're already getting killed even without being executed.

Still, it's interesting to see that Hamas probably changed their mind regarding the killing of hostages. It would not have been good PR for sure, although it would've undoubtedly been effective in pressuring Israel. But at the same time, it would've only justified a harsher Israeli response."

– Airstrikes on Gaza. Still a huge lack of food, water, medicine and electricity. The healthcare sector in Gaza is non-existent, as it has been for days. The situation is just horrible, and nothing is changing.

– Hamas carried out rocket barrages into central Israel, causing local power outages and limited damage to infrastructure.

– For the first time since the beginning of the war, not a single Hezbollah activity or action took place today, but they did announce 3 more martyrs, making the total 47.

– Despite no actions from Hezbollah, the IDF shelled South Lebanon numerous times throughout the day.

– Hundreds of fuel trucks are stuck at the Iraqi-Jordanian border crossing due to protesting Iraqis blocking the road and the checkpoint, to prevent the fuel from reaching Israel through Jordan.

– The Islamic Resistance in Iraq targeted the Al-Shaddadi base in Syria and the U.S. base in Erbil International Airport.

– The UN General Assembly met in an emergency meeting called by Jordan and Mauritania. Iran's Foreign Minister warned the US that the war could become regional if the agression on Gaza does not stop.

– Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said that the ground operation in Gaza will begin 'soon', when the conditions are right. He also said Israel is ready for a war on the northern front, if needed.

– Israeli troops stationed in the Eritrean 'Dahlak Islands' came under attack from unknown assailants, and at least one senior officer was killed.

– Each day, the IDF carries out 'probing raids' into the Gaza strip, likely to test for areas of resistance before a ground invasion. This also happened today.

– As a response to Hezbollah attacks, the IDF carried out artillery shellings and drone strikes on Hezbollah positions in South Lebanon, but once again much less than previous days.

– The Islamic Resistance in Iraq carried out an attack on the U.S. base in Kharab Al-Jir in Syria in the afternoon, and an attack on the Ayn Al-Assad base in Iraq during the very early morning hours of October 26th.

– An Israeli UAV crashed in Ma'alot Tarshiha. Cause currently unknown, although a Hezbollah surface-to-air missile was fired at an IAF drone earlier in the evening.

And although this might be true, this account claims to have a source 'close to the Quds Force' and therefore they are in the know.

Well, I just felt the need to call out these strange claims. No one has 'sources' in or close to the Quds Force. They are extremely secretive, and even their very own members are surveilled; the IRGC has a dedicated 'intelligence protection' branch with the sole purpose of checking and monitoring each member.

The members of the QF have no private lives. Before joining, which only happens through trusted acquaintances (you cannot just apply, you get picked), members are thoroughly vetted and every aspect of their lives is taken under the microscope. Any social media post you ever made, any university article you ever wrote, even conversations you had with your wife and family, everything. For reference, Qasem Soleimani was initially denied entry into the IRGC because he used to wear jeans, which was seen as a sign of irreligion, so just imagine the ideological standards of the QF.

They use secure phones, laptops and communication channels, and in most cases even their own family members do not know that they are a part of the Quds Force. 

No one even really knows what the QF does on a daily basis, and American intelligence specialists have described them as 'more secretive than the CIA'. 

So basically, having a source there, or a source close to them, is borderline impossible.

We were under strict guard. A paramedic and doctor came and made sure that we always had the medicines we took. They were very interested in the health aspect, therefore we had a doctor.

An attaché came every two or three days to see how we were being treated. They took responsibility and made sure to bring medicines, and if there were no identical medicines, they would give us equivalent ones. They were very kind and made sure we ate well, we ate the same food as them. We were treated well. They paid attention to every detail. They also had women with us who knew the meaning of feminine hygiene. They made sure we had everything.

– As a response to Hezbollah attacks, the IDF carried out artillery shellings, drone strikes and airstrikes on Hezbollah positions in Lebanon, but much less than previous days.

– The Islamic Resistance in Iraq carried out attacks on 5 U.S. occupation bases in Syria with suicide drones. They first struck Al-Tanf, Al-Rukban and Al-Malikiyah in the afternoon, and then Al-Omar oil field and Al-Shaddadi base in the evening. 

– IRGC-affiliated planes started using Khmeimim airbase in Syria for the first time.

2023-10-22T17:01:11+00:00,-1001626824086,"⚡🇪🇬 Regarding the IDF tank that targeted the Egyptian post.

There are several theories that I'm seeing around, and I would like to state them for the sake of honesty.

1- Israel purposefully targeted it with the permission of Israeli high command, to either 

1) See how the Egyptians would react to a slight escalation, in case Israel wishes to evict the Gazans purposefully across to Sinai

2) Drag Egypt into a war, considering Egypt is the only neighbor of Israel that has the manpower, equipment, and experience to fight a prolonged conventional, therefore solidifying American presence and forcing America to the war to protect Israel, a ""New U.S.S Liberty"" per say

2- The Israeli tank crew did this on their own perogative, three Israeli tourists were shot dead by an Egyptian Conscript in the Police, and before that three IDF soldiers were killed by an Egyptian soldier, therefore their emotions most likely were running high and did this independently.

3- The Israelis are trying to close the Rafah border crossing, and this was a message

The one thing of interest I would note is that suddenly, most of the opposition that was complaining that Egypt is being dragged into a war and that we should not mobilize more than the second and third army are now calling for war, fifth column or lowlifes? Beats me.

A response must be enacted, it may be of a military, political, or economic nature, who knows.

2023-10-20T23:03:50+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇶 'The Islamic Resistance in Iraq'

Since two days ago, we have seen U.S. military bases in Iraq come under rocket and drone attack. These attacks have been claimed by an unknown entity identifying itself as the 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq'.

Until two days ago, no one had really heard of this group, which reportedly first emerged after the assassination of General Soleimani. The name is very generic, and could possibly refer to any of the dozens of resistance factions operating inside Iraq today. But whoever they are, they have been dormant for several years.

What is clear, however, is that this group re-emerged after the Al-Aqsa Flood operation, and seems to be a direct response to U.S. involvement and support for the war on behalf of Israel.

The most logical and obvious scenario is that various Iranian-backed Shiite militias in Iraq have united under a joint command structure, or have at least agreed to issue joint statements as a united front, even if the attacks may have been carried out by different militias. 

It is very likely that a number of Shiite resistance factions that are ideologically close to Iran, such as Asa'ib Ahl al-Haqq, Kata'ib Hezbollah, Harakat al-Nujaba and others, have decided to publish joint statements to appear as a united front, calling themselves the 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq'.

Most of these factions still operate independently, but they coordinate with each other and are mutually connected by their dependence on Iran and the IRGC's Quds Force.

To summarise, I think that a handful of Shiite militias in Iraq, specifically the ones that are most loyal to Iran, have united at least to the extent of publishing joint statements under the name 'Islamic Resistance in Iraq'. This sends a symbolic message to the United States, while at the same time being a huge step in the unification of pro-Iranian factions in Iraq.

However, there is no doubt in my mind that whenever the IDF enters Gaza, at the very least we will see a huge increase in Hezbollah attacks on Israeli positions, even if it means they don't fully enter the war.

Some have commented and shared news that due to the expiry of the UN's resolution on Iranian missiles, Russia can now freely export missiles to Iran, which is technically true.

However, they also claim more specifically and without evidence, that Russian hypersonic missiles are 'probably' already arriving in Iranian ports.

First of all, Iran has their own domestically produced hypersonic missile (Fatah HGV) which was released earlier this year, they don't need Russian ones, and there is no evidence to suggest that Iran has expressed any interest in Russian missiles, and they're definitely not already arriving in Iranian ports. This whole story was made up on the spot and based on a false premise, and to be honest I don't know where it came from.

Second of all, whoever wrote that Iran will be interested in obtaining Russian missile technology, is seeing it the wrong way. The significance of the expiry of this UN charter was not for Russia to be able to export to Iran, but for Iran to be able to export to Russia. Iranian missiles are known to be extremely accurate, hard to intercept, and most importantly cost effective. This is why Russia has openly shown interest in Iranian missiles, not the other way round.

Iran's ballistic missile industry is fully domestic and self sufficient, and Iran does not seek to acquire any foreign missiles, as this is not needed. However, cooperation in the field of technological development, specifically when it comes to increasing the missile's range, cannot be excluded.

In the name of God,

Humanity mourns the horrific and brutal crime committed by the Zionist murder and criminal gangs in the Baptist Hospital in Gaza, which claimed the lives of hundreds of innocent martyrs.
 
This massacre is a continuation of the previous massacres since the establishment of this criminal, usurping entity, like Deir Yassin, Houla, and Sabra and Shatila.

All the way to the massacres of Qana and others throughout the years of the hateful occupation, which reveal the true criminal face of this entity and its sponsor, Satan, and the greatest wrongdoer, the United States of America.

Which bears direct and full responsibility for this massacre and for all crimes committed by the Zionist enemy.

All statements of condemnation and denunciation are no longer enough, and we call on the peoples of our Arab and Islamic nation to take immediate action in the streets and squares to express intense anger and put pressure on governments and states wherever they are.

International and regional organizations must take immediate action against the massacres and genocide of the oppressed Palestinian people and the implementation of forced displacement under the weight of massacres, terrorism and murder. ‏

Let tomorrow, Wednesday, be a day of unprecedented anger against the enemy and its crimes and against Biden’s visit to the Zionist entity to cover and protect this criminal entity.

Let the message be clear, that this is a day, after which only comes a path of of resistance, victory, and retaliation for the oppressed against the oppressor.

And God will be their helper.

– Hamas launched sporadic rocket attacks towards several cities including Tel Aviv and Ashkelon.

– Despite Egyptian statements that the Rafah border crossing would be opened for six hours during a temporary ceasefire, to allow aid into Gaza and to allow foreign nationals to leave, Israel and Hamas denied that a ceasefire deal had been reached. Only six trucks of fuel managed to cross the Rafah crossing before it was closed, leaving Palestinians without medical supplies, food and clean water.

– The IDF evacuated 28 Israeli settlements near the Lebanese border.

– Putin called the Iranian President.

– Netanyahu warned Iran and Hezbollah during a speech in the Knesset.

– Throughout the day, Hezbollah attacked many different IDF sites near the Lebanese border, destroying at least one Merkava tank. Among the sites that were targeted are Misgav, Khirbet Al-Manara, Harmon, Risha, Ramieh and Al-Dhahira.

– In response to the Hezbollah attacks, the IDF fired artillery at several towns in South Lebanon for a prolonged period of time, and announced that they carried out drone strikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon. The use of white phosphorus on Lebanese farmland was also recorded. 

– Major Syrian cities such as Latakia, Aleppo and Damascus tested their air raid sirens and early warning alarms for the first time in years.

2023-10-16T22:58:09+00:00,-1001626824086,"— 🇮🇱/🇵🇸 Another thing I want to say

It is very easy to get tied up in these tense situations, and some will start to think that every little thing is some kind of hint that a huge war is about to break out.

In reality, the vast majority of political and diplomatic statements are just that; political and diplomatic statements. Rarely are they ever put into practice, unless it is an official government announcement.

So far, all the messages and statements we have gotten from Iran and others have been vague, and usually in response to a reporters question or an interview. An answer to a reporter's question should be taken much less seriously than an official statement, because a statement is something that a government specifically and actively goes out of their way for.

Just remember that in most cases, the simplest possibility is probably the most likely possibility. The least dramatic one is probably the most likely to happen. 

Most of the statements being put out by politicians are just posturing, in hopes of avoiding a wide scale war, because in reality that's what nobody wants.

Try to take everything with a grain of salt and utmost skepticism.

They say that it says 'Nasrallah' in Arabic. Yes it does, but Nasrallah simply means 'victory of God' in Arabic, and the entire sentence is an excerpt from the Qur'an, nothing more and nothing less.

It is not some sort of cryptic message that Nasrallah or Hezbollah will be involved in the war, although that might still happen. 

People have also pointed out that the 'Iran in Arabic' account on Twitter posted the same message ('the victory of God is near'), but they simply took it from Abu Obaidah's speech as it is a common Quranic quote used to wish for victory.

The only real possibility right now of an escalation, is Hezbollah joining the war against Israel.

Talks of Iran joining, or even Syria or Shia militias and houthis, are wishful thinking and 99% won't happen.

Iran sees the militias in Iraq and Syria as an extension of itself, and it won't use them unless Iran is involved directly in a war. 

Hezbollah is independent, they make their own decisions, in consultation with Iran and the resistance. They are able to handle themselves and they have the agency and capability to act independently.

– Sporadic rocket barrages by Hamas from Gaza towards Ashkelon and Tel Aviv, but nothing really major.

– The PIJ launched a barrage of rockets from Lebanon towards Nahariya and Shlomi. 

– A huge increase of activity on the northern front throughout the day. Hezbollah targeted IDF sites with ATGMs, destroying radar sites, Merkava tanks and APCs. They also destroyed IDF surveillance equipment in the settlement of Metula with small arms. At least 6 separate Hezbollah attacks were recorded today, more than all previous days combined.

– Throughout the entire day at several different moments, the IDF fired artillery into South Lebanon and carried out helicopter patrols as well as drone strikes on Hezbollah targets, in response to the continuous targeting of IDF sites. As mentioned, the situation in the north has escalated and is now a constant loop of tit for tat.

The Al-Aqsa Flood operation reportedly took almost a full year of extensive planning, including consultations with regional powers and training of soldiers abroad.

Due to the extent and severity of the operation and the amount of planning involved, Hamas undoubtedly knew that Israel would be forced to respond proportionally. In fact, it is very likely that Hamas knew that an Israeli invasion of the Gaza strip would be inevitable after the operation. 

When you think about this, and the fact that Hamas probably already took this scenario into account, then you must ask yourself what is really waiting for the Israelis in Gaza.

This is a game of chess, Hamas knew exactly what the next move would be, and the Israelis are playing along.

However, there are several things wrong with this video, which can easily be noticed by anyone who thinks critically.

1. When the IDF soldier takess off the blindfold of the captive, his eyes have no difficulty adjusting to the light, which should be present after a prolonged period of being blindfolded.

2. When the IDF soldiers gives the greeting ""Salamu Alaykum"" (peace be upon you), the alleged Hamas fighter then replies ""Wa Alaykum Salam"" (peace be upon you too). This makes no sense at all, because Muslims believe it is not permissable to say this greeting to non-Muslims, especially not to an IDF soldier. For an ideologically motivated Hamas fighter to do this is even more unlikely, as he undoubtedly sees the Israelis as enemies and disbelievers.

3. The IDF soldier then asks the alleged fighter if he wants to say the 'Fatiha', which is an Islamic prayer and chapter from the Quran, and he proceeds to say it. This is highly unusual and strange, because there are only two occasions when Muslims say this prayer; during the 5 daily prayers and when someone has died. Neither is obviously the case here, and it is merely an attempt to thicken the narrative that this alleged prisoner is indeed a Muslim. 

4. The alleged fighter refers to Hamas as 'Hamas'. Although this might not initially seem strange, Hamas members do not actually use this term amongst themselves, rather they call themselves the 'Palestinian resistance', 'Islamic Resistance' or 'Al Qassam' (for the fighters).

Well in that case Ben, are Israeli civilians 'people who go about their daily lives'? Because as far as I'm aware, each Israeli age 18 and up has to serve in the IDF. Your argument is invalid according to your own logic. 

If we go by your own narrative, it's the Palestinians who should be considered harmless civilians, and not the Israelis.

But that's clearly not what we've seen you say in the past few days.

In the name of God,

We were not at all surprised by the political positions and measures taken by the American administration, especially the recent statements of the American President, in blatantly standing and declaring open support for the killing machine and the Zionist aggression against the Palestinian people. 

This is the true essence of the entire US policy in its continuous support for aggression and terrorism since the establishment of this usurping, occupying entity.

We consider the United States a full partner in the Zionist aggression and hold it fully responsible for the killing, criminality, siege, destruction of homes and buildings, and horrific massacres against defenseless civilians, including children, women, and the elderly.

We call on the people of our Arab and Islamic community, which knows the ugly truth of America and its aggression against the people of our nations in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, to condemn the American intervention and its international and regional partners and to expose this intervention at all political, popular, media and legal levels and in various regional and international forums and gatherings.

Sending aircraft carriers to the region with the aim of raising the morale of the enemy and its frustrated soldiers reveals the weakness of the Zionist war machine despite the crimes and massacres it commits, and thus its need for continuous external support to provide this temporary usurping entity with the means of sustainance. 

Therefore, we affirm that this step will not frighten the peoples of our nation or the factions of resistance. The resistance is ready for confrontation until final victory and complete liberation is achieved.

Victory belongs to God Almighty.

It's the 5th day of the war, and Israel still has not managed to push Hamas out of all its settlements around the Gaza strip.

As we speak, the settlements of Zikkim, Sufa and Ashkelon still have a sizeable Hamas presence.

Besides that, Hamas announced that it is sucessful in rotating its fighters and shows that it is maintaining a continuous operational frontline, which means they are still on the offensive.

And what about the Northern front?

Every single day since the start of the war has seen missiles from Palestinian factions based in Lebanon coming down on settlements in the Galilee.

And even more importantly, every single day, with no exceptions, has seen at least one Hezbollah attack on Israeli outposts, radar stations and troops. 

Last but not least, Israeli forces came under mortar fire in the occupied Golan Heights yesterday. The shells were fired from the territory of Syria. 

What exactly has the IDF been doing for the past 5 days? Were they really caught so off guard, that they could not even manage to secure at least one of their fronts correctly?

The Israeli armed capability, until now at least, has turned out to be a total myth. We will see what happens in the coming days, but IDF commanders will be scratching their heads as to what happened in the early days of this war.

In the name of God, the most Gracious, the most Merciful,

In a firm response to the Zionist attacks on Monday, 09-10-2023, which led to the martyrdom of a number our of mujahideen brothers, the martyrs: Hossam Ibrahim, Ali Fattouni, and Ali Hodraj. 

This morning, Wednesday 11-10-2023, the Mujahideen of the Islamic Resistance targeted the Zionist site of Al-Jardah, opposite the Al-Dhahira area, with guided missiles, which led to a large number of confirmed casualties among the ranks of the occupation forces, including dead and wounded. ‏

The Islamic Resistance reaffirms that it will be decisive in its response to the Israeli attacks targeting our country and the security of our people, especially when these attacks lead to the fall of martyrs.

Victory comes only from God, the Mighty, the most Wise.

Tharallah is a laser guided ATGM that fires two missiles consecutively, the first one disables the armor and activates any trophy system or ERA that may be present, and the second missile penentrates the vehicle.

This is a very recently adapted and quite advanced ATGM which Hezbollah first tested out this year, in 2023. As we can see, it turns out to be effective.

They are already in this conflict. They have been in it since the weekend. And there is no turning back.

The day before yesterday, Hezbollah destroyed two IDF outposts and an Israeli radar station with missiles.

Yesterday, Hezbollah fired ATGMs against two Israeli military sites, one of them being the command center of the IDF's Galilee division.

Today, they destroyed an Israeli M-113 APC across the border in Avivim with two ATGMs.

The snowball has started rolling, and in my opinion, it's only a matter of time before the northern front officially opens up.

When Musk found out this was the case, he quickly asked War Monitor to stop using 'biased words' like ""martyrs"", ""murdered"" etc. to refer to Palestinian deaths, otherwise he would stop recommending the account.

War Monitor did not care, and replied to Musk saying we cannot be 'objective' and politically correct when we see what is happening to Palestine.

Elon Musk then unfollowed him and withdrew his recommendation.

This shows you, we don't need their validation, we don't need their support, people will see the truth, and no one can stop it. God bless the resistance.

In the name of God,

Jihad has been ordered to those on whom war is imposed; Because they have been oppressed and without a doubt God is fully able to help them. (Qur'an)

Hezbollah congratulates the nation and the Palestinian resistance and the Mujahideen of the heroic factions of Palestine, especially the dear brothers in the Qassam Battalions and the Islamic Resistance Movement of Hamas, for this extensive and heroic operation.

This victorious operation is a decisive response to the continuous crimes of the occupation and the continuous attack on the sanctuaries, honor and dignity of the Muslims.

It is a new confirmation that the will of the Palestinian nation and the weapon of resistance is the only option against aggression and occupation, and a message to the Arab and Islamic world and the international community, especially those seeking normalization. The Palestinian issue is a living issue that will not die until victory and liberation.

We ask the people of the Arab and Islamic nations and the free people of the world to declare their support for the Palestinian people and the  movements that confirm their unity in blood, word and deed.

The leadership of the Islamic resistance of Lebanon is closely monitoring the important developments of the Palestinian scene and follows the field conditions with great interest and is in direct contact with the leadership of the Palestinian resistance, inside and outside, and maintains continuous communication with it. 

We are evaluating the events and the manner of carrying out the operations, and therefore, we ask the Zionist enemy government to understand the important lessons that the Palestinian resistance has taught to the field and arenas of confrontation and combat.
