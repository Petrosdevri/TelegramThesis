Palestine is a right, and we stand against Trump's plan for the Middle East. We will confront it.

'Dear friends, in just a few days, Lebanon will witness a great and exceptional event: the funeral of His Eminence, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, and the martyrs who stood with him. 

We, from Jerusalem, stand in reverence and honor for the sacrifices made by Sayyed Hassan and his companions, those who stood with Palestine, defended it, and paid a heavy price for it. We are loyal to these sacrifices. All Palestinians are loyal to the sacrifices of Sayyed Hassan and his comrades.

While we send our condolences from the heart of our holy city, we want to express that we will never forget those who stood with Palestine and defended it during the most difficult times and under the harshest conditions. Today, the Palestinian cause is being conspired against. Our enemies seek to displace our people and erase our cause. But the Palestinians will never raise the flag of surrender. We hold firmly to our rights, our principles, and our constants. The word 'surrender' has no place in our Palestinian dictionary.

Dear friends, we are all one family, one nation, facing the colonial projects that do not only target Palestine but the entire nation. Our message has always been, and will continue to be, that Palestine is the compass. Whoever’s compass is Palestine is in the right place, and whoever’s compass points elsewhere is in the wrong place. We urge them to correct their course and set their compass in the right direction.

Our dear friends, our message today is that we, as a community, must remain united, Christians and Muslims, across all sects and denominations. They want us to be fragmented, divided. They want us to speak the language of sectarianism. They want us divided so they can implement their projects, following the well-known adage 'divide and conquer.' They want to divide us so they can push forward their colonial projects that target Palestine and the entire nation.

We will remain Christians and Muslims in this region, one nation, with our compass pointing to Jerusalem, and our cause being Palestine. We must not allow anyone, or any entity, to push projects aimed at further division and fragmentation. We are one family, and that is how we have been, and how we will always remain.'

This is a political statement designed to pressure both the United States and the Israeli government and people. This is an example of the kind of resistance politically that Hamas puts up. No other Arab party – except maybe in Yemen – is really doing this in a sustained manner.

This is the reason why Hamas is taken seriously, because it does stick to the point and maintains political pressure to achieve its goals.

Hamas represents now better than anybody – certainly better than the Palestinian Authority and the PLO – the collective Palestinian will, and that includes the will to co-exist with the state of Israel with its Jewish majority.

🇺🇦🇷🇺 I personally don’t publish evolutions from the Russo-Ukrainian war anymore for a reason; the situation on the front is clearly a stalemate (clashes in Donetsk villages, siege of Pokrovsk, Russians are 4.5 kilometres from Dnipropetrovsk oblast and still don’t go in, Ukrainians conduct a counteroffensive in Kursk in an attempt to maintain their positions and fail). However, a topic I haven’t seen mentioned a lot in Telegram channels is drone warfare, and it’s where Ukrainians have a significant competitive edge, enabling them to deal constant damage to Russian energy and military facilities.

To conduct a thorough analysis, we need to compare the aerial weapons employed in long-range attacks. Moscow predominantly relies on the Shahed 136 drone (also referred to as Geran-2), a “kamikaze drone” that is utilised alongside ballistic and cruise missiles. Locally-produced variants usually range from below $20,000 to $50,000, while drones exported from Iran are estimated at about $190,000 after a negotiated settlement. Even though Geran-2 remains a lethal weapon and is used frequently, it alone is not sufficient to conduct a sophisticated strike. Coupled with the high cost of missiles, with Kinzhals ranging up to $13 million, the Kremlin needs to cover significant expenses to plan a attack. The only field in which Russia was able to develop cost-effective drones was in reconnaissance operations, which are capable of detecting enemy defences in order to destroy them.

On the other hand, Ukraine possesses a diversified drone stack, employing it in both direct combat and long-range attacks. Obviously the main milestone is the minimisation of costs in FPV drones, which accelerated production and usage in the battlefield. However, it has also improved its long-range arsenal, with notable examples being UJ-22, UJ-26 and An-196 Lyutyy and the second drone costing only about $100,000 per piece. Nevertheless, latest power struggles and corruption in government drone procurements could pose a threat to the buildup.

In modern wars, military supremacy alone cannot win wars; the battlefield requires a consistent flow of cutting-edge technology, which should gradually become cheaper by reducing marginal costs. I believe we could draw parallels to the strategies used by non-state actors, such as Ansarullah and HTS taking into account they both developed cheaper drone models to offset enemies relying on more expensive technology."

Antisemitism sometimes targets Jews not as individuals but as a collective – whether that’s Jewish organizations, movements like Zionism or the Jewish State of Israel.

So based on this, every critic of the Gaza war is antisemantic.

There will also be an interim security mission made up of troops from US-allied countries along with vetted Palestinian personnel, which will enforce security in the Strip. Israel will provide significant funding to all sectors.

In essence, a reformed PA would control both the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

The US is pressing for a deal before Donald Trump takes office on 20 January. Through  Trump’s Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff, Netanyahu has been forced to accept compromises. While the Israeli PM had been pushing for a temporary ceasefire that only related to the first phase of the three-stage proposal Israel submitted last May, the final agreement is increasingly closer to the original offer, with clauses connecting the first phase with the two others. This will make it harder for Israel to resume fighting once the initial stage goes into place. It’s also rumoured that Israel will agree to withdraw from the Philadelphi Corridor during the first phase, even though most officials deny it up to date.

“A White House official said Friday the US identified a ninth telecommunications company impacted by a wide-ranging Chinese espionage effort and that further steps are planned to curb cyberattacks from Beijing.”
 reported Bloomberg.

China-linked APT group Salt Typhoon (also known as FamousSparrow and GhostEmperor) and has been active since at least 2019 and targeted government entities and telecom companies.

White House cyber adviser Anne Neuberger revealed that the new victim of Chine-linked APT was discovered after Biden administration’s released guidance to detect their activity.

“The reality is that China is targeting critical infrastructure in the United States. Those are private sector companies, and we still see companies not doing the basics,”
 Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technologies, told reporters Friday.

“We know that voluntary cyber security practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,”
 Neuberger added.

In early December 2024, President Biden’s deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger said that China-linked APT group Salt Typhoon had breached telecommunications companies in dozens of countries.

The Wall Street Journal reported that the senior White House official revealed that at least eight U.S. telecommunications firms were compromised in the attack.

The Salt Typhoon hacking campaign, active for 1–2 years, has targeted telecommunications providers in several dozen countries, according to a U.S. official.

🇸🇾🇸🇾 — Deposed former Syrian president Bashar Alassad released a statement regarding the circumstances of his exit from Syria: [click to expand]:
Moscow - December 16, 2024

With the expansion of terrorism in Syria, and its arrival in the capital Damascus on the evening of Saturday, December 7, 2024, questions began to be raised about the fate and location of the president, amidst a torrent of confusion and stories far from the truth, which constituted support for the process of installing international terrorism as a Syrian liberation revolution.

At a critical historical moment in the life of the nation, when truth should have a place, there is something that needs to be clarified through a brief statement. These circumstances and the subsequent complete cessation of communication for security reasons did not allow for it to be made, and its brief points do not replace the narration of the details of everything that happened later, when the opportunity arises.

First of all, I did not leave the country in a planned manner as was rumored, nor did I leave it during the last hours of the battles, but rather I remained in Damascus following up on my responsibilities until the early morning hours of Sunday, December 8, 2024. With the expansion of terrorism inside Damascus, I moved in coordination with my Russian friends to Latakia to follow up on the combat operations from there. Upon arriving at the Hmeimim base in the morning, it became clear that the forces had withdrawn from all the battle lines and that the last army positions had fallen, with the deterioration of the field situation in that area increasing, and the attack on the Russian military base itself being escalated by drones. In light of the impossibility of leaving the base in any direction, Moscow asked the base leadership to work on securing immediate evacuation to Russia on the evening of Sunday, December 8, the day after the fall of Damascus, and after the fall of the last military positions and the subsequent paralysis of the rest of the state institutions.

During those events, the issue of asylum or resignation was not raised by me or by any person or party, and the only option presented was to continue fighting in defense of the terrorist attack.

In this context, I emphasize that whoever, since the first day of the war, refused to trade his country's salvation for personal salvation, or to bargain with his people with various offers and temptations, is the same person who stood with the officers and soldiers of his army on the front lines, dozens of meters away from the terrorists in the hottest and most dangerous hotbeds of conflict, and is the same person who did not leave during the most difficult years of the war and remained with his family and people to face terrorism under bombardment and the danger of terrorists storming the capital more than once during fourteen years of war. And whoever did not abandon the non-Syrian resistance in Palestine and Lebanon, and did not betray his allies who stood with him, cannot be the same person who abandons his people to whom he belongs, or betrays them and his army.

I have never been a person who seeks positions on a personal level, but rather I considered myself the owner of a national project that derived its support from a people who believed in it. I carried the certainty of the will of that people and their ability to preserve their state and defend its institutions and choices until the last moment. With the fall of the state into the hands of terrorism, and the loss of the ability to provide anything, the position becomes empty and meaningless, and there is no meaning to remaining responsible in it.

2024-12-09T16:57:06+00:00,-1002043952453,"🇸🇾 - The Syrian National Socialist Party has issued a statement, commenting on the recent developments and the fall of the Assad Regime [click to expand]:
Following the various pivotal events that occurred after Operation Flood of Al-Aqsa, from aggression and genocide in occupied Palestine, and an attempt to invade Lebanon and eliminate its resistance, the event inside Syria came to have a strong impact on the region.

In this context, the Syrian Social Nationalist Party emphasizes the following:

1- As a result of the fall of the former regime, it is necessary to work to find an acceptable and appropriate solution for all our people in the Levant by creating an authority emanating from the will of the Syrians themselves, which governs the country and preserves the unity of its lands, society and interests, preserves institutions and consolidates the concept of citizenship and the national state, as well as defining for itself a clear and fixed compass, which is Palestine.

2- The Syrian Social Nationalist Party stresses that it is the duty of all national forces and every Syrian citizen to work to confront the Jewish invasion of southern Syria, in defense of the land, homeland and people, which cannot be liberated without a combat doctrine that is the basis for a national army that preserves the state and protects its lands, people and institutions. 

3- The party confirms that the institution of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is based on a 93-year-old doctrine that transcends any system and is not linked to any authority or state, as the party derives its presence and legitimacy from the struggles of the nationalists and our people and it remains and continues on Saadeh's path. The existence of the Syrian Social Nationalist Party is not linked to the fall of the regime in Syria, as the party was founded before the existence of the regime itself, and the last four years before its fall were characterized by the severing of relations with our party, the punishment of its officials and the oppression of the nationalists in Syria. The regime also contributed to the division and fragmentation of our party's institutions. 

4- The party calls on the Syrian Social Nationalists in the Levant to work under the umbrella of Antoun Saadeh's approach and thought by consolidating the concept of community unity, preserving and maintaining public institutions, preventing any aggression against them, rejecting sectarian discourse, and cooperating with the forces that ensure the realization of the interests of the state and the people, and protecting citizens and property.

5- Calling on the Lebanese interior to spare all Lebanese the pitfalls of chaos whose features have begun to appear. We call for not betting on what they consider a loss for the national resistance project in order to avoid strife, which if it occurs, its fire will reach everyone.
The party demands that the Lebanese state and its military and security apparatuses prevent any attack or provocation sought by some hot-headed and irresponsible heads against any party office, and work to establish security and freedom of expression under the umbrella of the law and protect public and private property to preserve the unity of the country and ward off strife.

The Syrian Social Nationalist Party derives its spirit from its leader, Antoun Saadeh, and his teachings, and depends for its continuity on the vitality of the Social Nationalists and their struggle, jihad, political, and reformist project."

We, in the Hamas movement and our Palestinian people, stand firmly with the great Syrian people, and we affirm the unity of Syria and the integrity of its territories, and respect for the Syrian people, their will, independence, and political choices.

The brotherly Syrian people, with all their spectrums, national unity, and the spirit of brotherhood and tolerance, are capable, God willing, of overcoming all challenges and passing through this critical stage, in a way that achieves goodness, development, security, stability and prosperity for Syria and its dear people, so that Syria can continue its historical and pivotal role in supporting the Palestinian people and their resistance to achieve the goals of their just cause, and to consolidate Syria’s leadership role at the level of the Arab and Islamic nation, and at the regional and international levels.

We, in the Hamas Movement, condemn in the strongest terms the repeated brutal aggression of the Zionist occupation against Syrian lands, and we categorically reject any Zionist ambitions or plans targeting our sister Syria, its land and its people.

➡️On October 28, we spotted a German cargo ship called ""KATHRIN - Catherine"" docked at the port of Alexandria, Egypt, via the ""Marine Traffic"" program. 
According to the official website of the port of Alexandria, the ship entered the port to carry out military unloading operations, and is expected to leave the port on November 5. 
(2nd and 3rd pictures)

➡️It was scheduled to dock at the Namibian port of Walvis Bay on August 25.
But a day before its arrival, Namibia revoked its docking permit because the ship was carrying military cargo and explosives for Israel. (4th picture)

➡️The ship was forced to continue its course.
On August 29, the website ""Portugal Resident"" reported that the ship was sailing under the flag of the Portuguese islands of Madeira.
This angered the Portuguese opposition, which pressured the government to withdraw the flag from the ship. (5th picture)

➡️On September 19, the newspaper ""Publiko"" quoted the office of the Prime Minister of Slovenia and the Portuguese Foreign Minister indicating that the ship ""Katherine"" is heading to Montenegro and Slovenia. 
It explained that it will unload its cargo in the Slovenian port of ""Kober"", but without any clarification on how the shipment will then reach Israel. (6th image)

➡️Days after this statement, specifically on September 24, solidarity groups with Palestine in Montenegro called on their government to prevent the ship from docking in its ports.
Amnesty International also issued a report on October 1, calling on Slovenia, Montenegro and Portugal not to assist the ship in delivering explosives to Israel.
Indeed, the ship was unable to dock in Montenegro as a result of pressure campaigns.
(7th and 8th images)

➡️With further tracking, we found that the ship was on its way to Croatia on October 3, as a possible stop.
Then the boycott movement called on its supporters to take action and send a letter to Croatian Foreign Minister Gordan Grlić Radman to prevent the ship from docking in the country.
The Croatian government responded to the pressure campaigns and banned the ship from docking in its ports.

➡️On October 7, Maltatoday reported that the Maltese Ministry of Transport had rejected all service requests from ships carrying weapons bound for Israel. 
Then, on October 10, the same website reported that Malta had refused to provide the ship with food and water while it was anchored outside its territorial waters.
(10th image)

➡️In response to pressure campaigns against the Portuguese government, the Catherine was forced on October 17 to officially abandon the Portuguese flag and sail under the German flag.

➡️After this difficult journey and boycott campaigns, the ship loaded with explosive materials to Israel docked at the port of Alexandria, announcing that it was its final stop and the site for unloading its cargo.

After 11 days, the party began to regain its status by filling the gaps.

The field proves and confirms the party's recovery from the attacks it was subjected to because it is a large and cohesive institution with great potential.

Hezbollah has a real jihadist history and was strong year after year and gaining more experience. All our preparations have to do with the possibility of fighting a long-term war.

The resisters on the front lines are full of faith and courage, and they are martyrs and no one can advance on them.

As our master said, “We are waiting for the docking,” and confrontations are focused on the front edge and the enemy is afraid as he changes his statements and goals.

All the required capabilities are in the resistance on the fronts and they are steadfast and capable.

The ability of the Resistance to erect platforms despite the continuous airstrikes is exceptional and we are fighting with honor.

We target the bases and the military, but they target humans, humans and stones and want to hurt us.

The enemy must know that his bombing of our villages and cities will not make us retreat and the Resistance is strong and it was able to deliver a march to Netanyahu's room.

Netanyahu survived this time “and maybe his time has not yet come”.

We hurt the enemy and our targeting of the base of “Banyamna” is proof of this, as well as the targeting of Haifa, Acre and others.

You will inevitably be defeated because the earth is ours and our people are cohesive around us.

We fight on our land and liberate our occupied land, and no one asks us for anything and does not oblige us to anything.

Get out of our land to ease your losses, otherwise you will pay an unprecedented price.

As we won in July, we will win now and we will remain strong with an increasing rise of our power.

The party will emerge from this confrontation stronger and victorious. 

The battle requires this level of sacrifices and we are in the stage of achoring the enemy, the stage of steadfastness and patience is added to it.

Days after the Al-Aqsa flood, there were serious discussions between the entity and America in order to hit Hezbollah.

With Resistance, we disrupt the Israel project and we are able to do so.

Netanyahu himself said at the start of his aggression against Lebanon that it is for the sake of the new Middle East and we broke a series of surprises

This war has all the potential in the world to eliminate the Resistance. They want us to become susceptive to control our future.

This Zionist war is an American and a global European war with the aim of eliminating Resistance in the region.

The legendary steadfastness of the resistance in Gaza and Lebanon is the epic of pride and it will create the future of our generations.

We have repeatedly said that we do not want a war, as our master stressed, but we are ready if it is imposed on us and we will face it with pride.

We are not fighting on behalf of anyone, but for the protection of Lebanon and the liberation of our land and the attribution to Gaza.

Iran supports us and does not want anything from us. We welcome any Arab and Islamic country that wants to support us in the face of Israel.

We salute the figure of Imam Khomeini (Quds) who launched the project to remove Israel for the owners of the land.

Imam Khamenei carried the flag with courage and give all the required support so that they are in the service of the Mujahideen.

Iran realizes the price it pays because of its support for the Resistance, and it gave it through the martyr, General Soleimani, unless no one gave him.

We fight on our land and liberate our occupied land, and no one asks us for anything and does not oblige us to anything.

We thank the support fronts in Yemen and Iraq.

The crisis of the pagers and radios devices affected 4,000 Lebanese, including fighters and civilians.

The extent of Hezbollah's targeting, especially the targeting of its leader after the pager bombings, was painful for us, but the party regained its status.

The first operation targeted the ship ""SC MONTREAL"" southern Arabian Sea with two drones and the hit was accurate.

The second operation targeted the ship (MAERSK KOWLOON) in the Arabian Sea. The operation was carried out with a cruise missile, achieving a direct hit.

The third operation was carried out by the naval forces and the missile force, targeting the ship (MOTARO) in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab with a number of ballistic missiles, and the strikes were accurate and direct.

The statement reads:
“Statement issued by the Yemeni Armed Forces

The third operation was carried out by the naval forces and the missile force, targeting the ship (MOTARO) in the Red Sea and Bab al-Mandab with a number of ballistic missiles, and the hits were accurate and direct, thanks be to God.

The targeting of the three ships came as a result of the companies that own them violating the decision to ban entry into the ports of occupied Palestine.

The Yemeni Armed Forces, while hailing the victories of the Islamic Resistance in Lebanon and the steadfastness of the Islamic Resistance in Gaza, affirm their continuation in imposing a naval blockade on the Israeli enemy, as well as carrying out targeting operations with missiles and drones for all targets belonging to the Israeli enemy in occupied Palestine, and that these operations will not stop except by stopping the aggression, lifting the blockade on the Gaza Strip, and stopping the aggression on Lebanon.

The leadership of the Hamas movement has initiated a series of intense political and diplomatic movements and contacts aimed at thwarting the occupation’s plans and halting the compound crime being carried out in the framework of the genocide war and open massacres across the Gaza Strip, particularly in the northern part of the Strip.

During its ongoing political contacts, the leadership of the movement warned against the implementation of the generals plan and the consequences of displacement and destruction. The movement highlighted the scale of daily massacres, which have reached horrific levels of terror and killing, including the execution of children and women in cold blood and the systematic displacement of around 150,000 people, along with the starvation and deprivation of our people of all essentials, including food, medicine, water sources, and the complete destruction of infrastructure, especially hospitals.

At this time, delegations from the movement’s leadership are visiting Turkey, Qatar, and Russia. The contacts have also included Egypt, the United Nations, and Iran.

Further communications are planned with additional countries at the leadership and official levels in the region. Hamas has called on the media to expose the crimes of the occupation in this area, which are being committed daily and intensively.

The images you see are different from what the people of Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad or Hezbollah see.

They see a man who fought until the last minute, until the last drop of blood. Even when he is wounded. Of course, he is not humiliated.

Sinwar has already become a legend; a figure that is much greater than the man himself. It is good that he was eliminated, but no amount of liquidation will change the legend for future generations.

It must be said: as Israelis, it is difficult for us to understand Hamas.

💬 I believe Netanyahu understands very well that the Axis of Resistance is going to continue striking Israel no matter the assassinations or the leadership changes until Israel backs down from its war in Gaza.

We are the sons of the master of the martyrs of the Resistance Axis Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah.

Al-Aqsa Flood is an exceptional event and is the beginning of changing the face of the Middle East in the presence of resistance, its jihad and influence.

The jihad of the Mujahideen from Hamas and jihad and all the Palestinian people is a 100% project work.

The goal of the occupation was not to react to the Al-Aqsa flood, but to end the Resistance completely and exterminate the Palestinian people.

Greetings to the martyrs, headed by the martyr President Ismail Haniyeh, and greetings to the wounded and all the people of Palestine.

The Resistance of Gaza is legendary and it is able to withstand and resist in Palestine and is not defeated.

Iran supports the Resistance and is determined to support the Resistance with everything it deems appropriate.

Yemen's tenders are great and the Iraqi Resistance has made and done a lot for the benefit of Palestine.

The Lebanon Front exhausted the enemy for 11 months and expelled the settlers from their settlements and the enemy's losses are great.

The enemy opened the war on Lebanon, benefiting from American support, but the war will not affect our will and our determination to confront.

The meeting of the Israeli enemy and with him America and Western countries does not scare us.

Netanyahu can say that he wants war, but he cannot achieve his goals from it.

We are hitting the enemy and expanding the range of missiles and planes and we will lengthen the place in the time you decide according to our plan.

Reassure everyone that our potential is fine and what the enemy said about his long potential is an illusion and a lie.

The Mujahideen have proven their worth in the field and because they are the sons of Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, they can only be so.

Netanyahu says he wants to return the settlers and we tell him that he will abandon the town.

2024-09-24T17:30:23+00:00,-1002043952453,"💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:

🇱🇧🇮🇱 At this point, we see the same story unfolding every day:
🔸 Hezbollah bombs northern Israeli settlements, including military sites.
🔸 Israel strikes southern Lebanon and tries to kill a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut.
🔸 Hezbollah bombs Israel again, targeting mainly military bases.
🔸 Israel has material damages, Lebanon suffers many casualties.
🔸 Repeat and roles may change on who bombs first during the day.

A valid question raised by many is about whether Hezbollah can maintain its role in Lebanon as “a state within a state”. 

For now, Hezbollah has much support in the south (among Shi’ites and some Christians) due to its role in the 1985-2000 and 2006 wars, which was largely victorious and defended Beirut from Israeli aggression. It didn’t disarm after the conflicts, exerted pressure on the Lebanese political system in order to solidify its presence, gained experience at the Syrian battlefield and continued stacking missiles for ages. 

However, as the casualties in Lebanon increase and more high ranking officials are murdered, it is bound for the organisation to conduct similar operations against Israeli officers, thus inflicting heavy blows on Tel Aviv. This solution becomes more urgent as Israel is conducting advanced operations against its members using the leverage of its espionage network and its technology edge, as we saw with the interruption of communication methods and precision strikes.

Whether it is actually feasible to see direct strikes on the Israeli leadership, it is to be answered in the next months. In a global geopolitical environment without limits and with the past’s fear of a nuclear apocalypse sidelined, many actors rely on escalation to achieve their goals."

Thanks to the Lebanese government, the Ministry of Health, hospitals, health centers, health care institutions, doctors and nurses.

Thanks to the Iraqi government, the Islamic Republic, and the Syrian government that opened the doors of their hospitals and provided support, and to everyone who condemned this heinous crime. 

What happened on Tuesday was the enemy targeting pagers and detonating them simultaneously, thus crossing all laws and red lines and not caring about anything, neither humane nor moral. 

The enemy used a civilian method used by large segments of society and did so again on Wednesday by blowing up wireless devices without caring who was carrying them. As a result of this aggression, dozens of martyrs, including children, women and civilians, were killed. 

The enemy assumes that the pagers, which number more than 4,000, are distributed among the brothers and sisters in Hezbollah, and in doing so, it was deliberately killing 4,000 people in one minute. 

On the second day, the enemy intended to kill thousands as well, meaning that over the course of two days, the Israeli enemy wanted to kill no less than 5,000 in two minutes. 

This is criminal act and a major terrorist operation, an act of genocide and massacre, and amounts to a declaration of war.

Many of the injuries were minor, and a number of the pagers were out of service, far away, or not distributed at all.

We formed technical and security investigation committees and are studying all hypotheses and have reached a semi-result, but this file is under investigation and close follow-up, whether from the company to manufacturing to transportation and procedures in Lebanon to distribution, and when we reach a result, the matter will be based on its requirements.

We received a severe blow, but this is the state of war, and we realize that the enemy has technological superiority, especially since it is supported by the United States and the West.

2024-09-17T14:30:06+00:00,-1002043952453,"💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:

🇱🇧🇮🇱 After some interesting research, here are some key details which could indicate an Israeli involvement in the attack:

🔸 Israel must have had access to the supply chain of pagers, which could be done by bribing corrupt Lebanese officials. The Lebanese financial crisis and animosity by some parties towards Hezbollah can create alluring chances for Israeli officials to recruit opponents, making their operations more efficient.
🔸 Israel could therefore obtain access to the production phase of pagers, including installing explosive components that could be triggered by remote control.
🔸 At the same time, Israel is tracking the location of many officials through their cell phones and it’s monitoring footage of security cameras in southern Lebanon, which has made Hezbollah fighters use couriers and the organisation request citizens to disconnect their cameras from the internet. 

Now a question is; couldn’t this be done earlier, for instance when Hezbollah entered the war in autumn? The answer is uncertain, but in my opinion, the northern front wasn’t seen as much threatening as Gaza. Now that Israel has thousands of people who evacuated borderline settlements, the military leadership is beginning to change its goals. At the same time, people like Gallant and Halevi want to avoid a direct confrontation, favouring an asymmetric conflict instead.

Furthermore, Israel has used other methods to accomplish assassinations and precision strikes, such as using Arab informants to call up suspects or the measures mentioned above.

All in all, Israeli involvement in the incident is very likely and can set a prelude for a new 2006."

🇺🇸🇮🇱🏴 Today marks the 23rd anniversary of the September 11 attacks in the United States, which notably led to the World Trade Center (WTC) getting destroyed and cost the lives of 2,977 people. This came a day after defense secretary Ronald Rumsfeld said that the Pentagon was unable to account for $2.3 trillion in transactions. The attacks were carried out by Al-Qaeda and the Bush administration launched a “global war on terror” by invading Afghanistan, Iraq and Pakistan among other states, causing more than 4 million deaths.

I won’t publish a “red-pilled” take on the 9/11 attacks, as it’s not something I have thoroughly explored, however I do hope the perpetrators are held accountable and people understand its global implications."

Harris said that Trump’s tariffs would create a sales tax one the middle class, even though she supported a more interventionist healthcare policy. She accused her opponent of organising January 6 and not agreeing to lose the elections, and repeated tropes about his abortion policy and foreign ties. Harris also went after his legal battles and emphasised she would continue supporting Israel in foreign affairs, alienating many progressive voters.

Trump focused on immigration, national security, and the failures of the Biden administration. He called out Harris for the failed Afghanistan withdrawal, which set the pretext for the war in Ukraine, and expressed once again he would end the war. He also went after the moderation of 2020 campaign promises, saying she is virtually the same. The former president defended his abortion stances and his administration policies on the pandemic.

Both candidates appeared arrogant, with Kamala laughing, smirking and raising her tone, while Trump remained short-tempered, which boosts his appeal to his supporters. Both of them didn’t manage to answer some questions.

💬 I didn’t watch it for obvious reasons, however most liberal media seem to be worried about Harris’ chances.

We had already evacuated all the valleys containing precision and ballistic missiles, so what the enemy bombed today were empty valleys.

The enemy’s claim that it targeted ballistic missiles prepared to strike Tel Aviv is false.

The drone sites were not hit, and the missile launch pads fired their missiles without being damaged in the pre-raids.

The enemy initiated the raids half an hour before the Resistance operation, sensing the movement of the Mujahideen rather than acting based on intelligence information.

The enemy is claiming hundreds of raids, but in reality, they only hit two missile launch pads.

What occurred was an act of aggression, not a preemptive action, and it had no impact on our operation today or on our Mujahideen.

We are confronted with an Israeli narrative filled with falsehoods and intelligence failures; in contrast, our military operation was executed exactly as planned, despite all the challenging circumstances.

Today, we witnessed a scene that vividly demonstrates the courage of the resistance and its supporters, who acted boldly despite all the American and Western intimidation.

2024-08-25T15:45:41+00:00,-1002043952453,"🇱🇧 Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah in his speech:
Today is the fortieth anniversary of Imam Hussein (PBUH) on the 20th of Safar, who is a symbol of sacrifice, altruism, rejection of injustice and submission, and the title of the revolution until the Day of Judgment.

The Resistance declared its commitment and determination to respond to the brutal aggression on Beirut’s southern suburb in order to maintain the equations for which blood and sacrifices were shed.

We have named our large-scale military operation “Operation Arbaeen Day” to commemorate its occurrence on this significant day, which holds profound historical importance.

The delay in the operation was caused by American and Israeli mobilization, and this delay also served as a form of punishment for the enemy.

We delayed our response to allow sufficient time for the ongoing negotiations concerning Gaza.

We established guidelines for our response, ensuring that targets would not be civilians or enemy infrastructure, but rather military sites directly linked to the assassination operation.

We have identified the “Galilot” base as a primary target for Operation Arbaeen Day. This base houses Unit 8200, which specializes in intelligence gathering, eavesdropping, and espionage. It is situated 110 kilometers from the Lebanese border and just 1,500 meters from the border of Tel Aviv.

The plan wasto launch 300 Katyusha rockets and disperse them across various sites. This number was deemed sufficient to overwhelm the Iron Dome and its interceptor missiles for several minutes, allowing the drones to proceed.

No Resistance platforms were hit before the operation began. The resistance successfully launched 340 missiles, and all drone sites deployed their drones despite the raids. Remarkably, no site was damaged, either before or after the operation.

Our data suggests that a substantial number of drones successfully reached the two specified targets; however, as usual, the enemy is keeping this information confidential.

If there were any casualties in Nahariya, Acre, or other locations, they were caused by Israeli interceptor missiles.

This danger cannot be faced with fear and hesitation; all Muslims must assume their responsibilities.

Israel falsely claimed to have destroyed our strategic missiles, despite knowing that we have not used them yet and may do so in the future.

We, the leaders of France, Germany and the United Kingdom, welcome the tireless work of our partners in Qatar, Egypt and the United States towards an agreement on a ceasefire and the release of hostages. We endorse the joint statement of HH Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al Thani, President Sisi and President Biden calling for the immediate resumption of negotiations. We agree that there can be no further delay. We have been working with all parties to prevent escalation and will spare no effort to reduce tensions and find a path to stability. The fighting must end now, and all hostages still detained by Hamas must be released. The people of Gaza need urgent and unfettered delivery and distribution of aid.

We are deeply concerned by the heightened tensions in the region, and united in our commitment to de-escalation and regional stability. In this context, and in particular, we call on Iran and its allies to refrain from attacks that would further escalate regional tensions and jeopardise the opportunity to agree a ceasefire and the release of hostages. They will bear responsibility for actions that jeopardise this opportunity for peace and stability. No country or nation stands to gain from a further escalation in the Middle East.

We meet today to honor one of those men who have proven true to what they pledged to Allah.

Martyr Shokr had a strategic mind and was the chief of the operations chamber in 2006 and one of the makers of the liberation victory in 2000.

Recent developments have unveiled the real goals of Netanyahu governments.

Hezbollah and Iran have the ability to respond to the Israeli assassinations but will act cautiously and carefully.

Israeli ministerial remarks about nuking Gaza and Knesset’s resolution on rejecting a Palestinian state reflect the essence of the ongoing battle.

Israel is absolving itself of all Oslo stipulations and working to expel Palestinians from West Bank.

The Israeli enemy has annexed Golan Heights and Lebanon’s Shebaa Farms in order to complete the entity’s map-from the river to the sea.

If Netanyahu emerged victorious in Gaza and West Bank, Israel would control the region.

US policy in the region is hypocritical because it fully supports ‘Israel’ while claiming backing Gaza ceasefire and Palestinian state establishment.

Israel alleges that it has the most powerful army in the region, while it pleads the US protection in face of any Hezbollah or Iran strike.

If Israel emerged victorious in Gaza, all Palestine and Al-Aqsa Mosque would be lost.

Jordan and Golan Heights would be lost if Israel emerges victorious.

This danger cannot be faced with fear and hesitation; all Muslims must assume their responsibilities.

Israeli assassination of the two martyrs Fuad Shokr in Dahiyeh and Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran is an achievement, not a victory.

🔸To all our dear brothers in the resistance factions, to our Arab and Islamic peoples, and to every free and honorable resistor who considers himself a participant in this battle, we extend our condolences and blessings to them, especially to the family of Hajj Ismail Haniyeh.

🔸I extend my condolences to our brothers in the Hamas movement and the Al-Qassam Brigades on the martyrdom of Brother Ismail Haniyeh.

🔸Resistance movements, their leaders are martyred, as are their mujahideen

🔸In the incident of the martyrdom of Hajj Mohsen, the enemy’s main goal was to assassinate the great jihadi leader, Mr. Mohsen, as a civilian building full of residents in the southern suburb was targeted, which led to the martyrdom of 7 civilians and dozens of wounded, most of them women and children.

🔸We are in pain. Who said that we are not in pain! But we are patient and we stand firm. We face and confront with beautiful patience, submission, contentment, and trust in God.

🔸The enemy considered the assassination a response to what happened in Majdal Shams, and this is the greatest fraud and deception operation.

🔸This is not a reaction to what happened in Majdal Shams, but rather this is an allegation and deception, and it is part of the war and the battle.

🔸The second hypothesis strongly proposed is that the missile is an Israeli interceptor missile.

🔸The goal of accusing the resistance of what happened in Majdal Shams is sectarian strife.

🔸We have a lot of evidence that many Israeli interceptor missiles fell on Akka and other areas.

🔸When the occupation found that the victims in Majdal Shams were mostly children and women, they decided to proceed with accusing us.

🔸Several countries asked us not to respond to the occupation’s strike on the southern suburbs of Beirut.

🔸We are paying the price for our support of Gaza and our support for the Palestinian cause. This is not new, and we accept this price and pay it.

🔸Netanyahu wanted to use the assassination of Commander Fouad Shukr as an achievement for those who accuse him of failure.

🔸We are paying the price for our support of Gaza, and hundreds of martyrs, including civilians, rose for us

🔸All of us, not just the martyrs on the front lines and our families, entered the battle and carried blood on our palms.

🔸All of us, not just the martyrs on the front lines and our families, entered the battle and our blood on our palms.

🔸What is happening is no longer support fronts, but rather a major open battle whose battlefields include Gaza, southern Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq, and Iran.

🔸The awareness and firm positions of a group of Druze leaders in Lebanon and Syria helped to eliminate strife.

🔸When Iranians talk about the assassination of Haniyeh, they consider that the incident harmed their sovereignty, national security, prestige and honor.

🔸The Israelis do not know which red lines they have crossed, and on all support fronts we have entered a new phase.

One of the reasons I am publishing mostly news headlines is because many rumours on Telegram channels are usually unconfirmed. I also choose news agencies and media with opinions that fit the channel’s viewpoints (for example support for the Axis of Resistance).

Regarding the affairs in the Middle East, I believe Iran will respond fiercely and will take time to calculate its response because it has to take into account Western support for Israel, in particular potential interceptions like in April. Iran needs to target the Israeli leadership directly and support both Hezbollah and the Houthis, which have proven to be the most damaging adversaries of Netanyahu."

Σήμερα είναι η 50ή επέτειος της εισβολής της Τουρκίας στην Κύπρο, η οποία προκάλεσε τον εκτοπισμό 162.000 Ελληνοκυπρίων και έθεσε υπό παράνομη κατοχή το 36% του νησιού, η οποία συνεχίζεται και σήμερα. Η πολιτική ηγεσία της χώρας μας στο πλαίσιο καλλιέργειας της «ελληνο-τουρκικής φιλίας» έχει παραμελήσει το Κυπριακό ζήτημα και αφήνει την αδελφική χώρα στο έλεος του γείτονα. Με αφορμή το συμβάν θα ανεβεί ένας χάρτης κατά τη διάρκεια της ημέρας.

ΤΟΥΡΚΟΙ ΔΕ ΞΕΧΝΩ!  


Today is the 50th anniversary of Turkey's invasion of Cyprus, which caused the displacement of 162,000 Greek Cypriots and placed 36% of the island under illegal occupation, which continues to this day. The political leadership of our country, in the context of cultivating ""Greco-Turkish friendship"", has neglected the Cyprus issue and is leaving the sisterly country at the mercy of its neighbour. On the occasion of the incident, a map will be uploaded during the day.

TURKS I DON'T FORGET!"

2024-06-11T16:30:01+00:00,-1002043952453,"💬 @PoliticsGR Commentary:

Apparently, Gantz wants to return to opposition in order to present himself as an alternative to the current chaos the Israeli government has turned into and potentially even overthrow the government by demanding new elections. Zionist hawks in Times of Israel and Jerusalem Post relentlessly attack Gantz and try to present ultranationalists Ben-Gvir and Smotrich as empowered by his resignation, while ""liberal"" Zionists in Haaretz praised his decision and continue to bash Netanyahu for sabotaging peace negotiations. Netanyahu keeps fighting the war solely for his political survival and it's evident there is no plan to ""reconstruct"" Gaza. For supporters of the Resistance this is a turn which should be regarded with caution as I don't think he would mind to join hands with Jewish supremacists if they offer him the necessary support."
