2025-02-20T09:16:58+00:00,-1001694389100,"Just a thought.

Trump is making a grand show of abandoning Ukraine and Europe in a necessary pivot to the Pacific. The U.S. pulls troops out from Europe as they are entirely unnecessary anyway for defense of the continent (1. Russia doesn’t want to invade Europe. 2. Nukes) This shows willingness to work with the Russians towards peace. Russians accept this concession in Europe and now without direct conflict with the U.S., European peace keeping contingents moves into to Ukraine as part of the deal/security guarantees. This secures the pause (ceasefire) the west needs with minimal loss to their geo strategic position. Europe spends the next 2-5 years focused on defense spending and slowly prepares for the next inevitable round.  I know one of the arguments will be “how will Europe do this with struggling economies”. Im sure you can eek 2-5 years out even if things are getting bad. There is also the Iran angle for the U.S. which could also be a topic of discussion at negotiations. If I remember correctly, US defense secretary Pete Hegseth called it “division of labor” when he was recently in Europe.

Alternative possibility is that the western alliance is at a breaking point and the U.S. is retreating from its global hegemony. Focusing instead on a new world order that likely excludes Europe in its current form. I don’t know if believe this is the case but time will tell. 

We’ll see if there is any high level chess being played in the weeks to come but this historically chaotic time is worth witnessing and remembering."

And to answer his question about why is happened? 

Because those were the orders from the top.

“Unfortunately, not everyone left Ulakli.

There are dead and captured😢

This could have been prevented if the order to leave the bag had been given in time.

But this was not done.

Because General Tarnavsky, as the commander of the Donetsk OTU, needs good reports from above that ""we have everything under control there.""

And in fact, control over the situation was lost 2 weeks ago. And the further it went, the more it escalated.

And here's the question - if the operational situation after the loss of the Andriyivka unit indicated the possibility of encirclement, why did the OTU so stubbornly refuse to evacuate the garrison?

Why did the situation get so bad?”"

Counterattacks in Ulakly failed. The village was practically captured.

Everything that is up to Ulakli from the Dachny side is lost.

In Constantinople, our soldiers are holding the road in the southern part of the village and the approaches to it.

In all other points of the village, enemy infantry, which had already accumulated normally, infiltrated.

One of our brigades and separate units of another were added to the direction, but they were unable to complete the tasks, there are problems with interaction, infantry, and chaos in management at the OTU level.

The commander of the Donetsk OTU, Tarnavsky, received a ""fiery"" greeting from the guys who were first ""forgotten"" in one of the villages, and then were not given the ""go"" to leave.

So why are there no longer these problems in the north of the Donetsk OTU's area of ​​responsibility, but in the south of the same OTU's area, they put a bolt, which caused a catastrophe?

You can't do that to our fighters! To the best fighters, because in that bag were some of the most trained brigades!

In fact, we now have the LBZ equation on the enemy side and a good bridgehead for an attack on both the Filiya-Hrushivske-Yalta triangle and Hulyaipole.

'People say: Look at Russia, it was a paper tiger, it's been three years and look how slow they progressed.

I ask anyone, with a genuine ounce of intellect, to look at the situation objectively. The Russians, for three years, have been advancing slowly and methodically in Ukraine. At the same time, they are conserving their economy to a large extent.

If the Russians would have gone all-out, what an effect on the economy would this have had? Do you understand the implications of full mobilization? This is a delicate balance.

Why should they sacrifice their domestic situation in order to get a quick victory, if they can sit, lean back, and complete the marathon. Additionally, Russia has taken every possible measure to avoid civilian casualties, unlike Kiev. Of course, this also impacts the effectiveness on the battlefield.

Lastly, look at the backers of Ukraine, and look at Russia. We Iranians know what it feels like to fight an enemy whom the whole world has rallied behind. This is what is now taking place in Ukraine, it is not simple.

Iran emphasizes the need for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, in a way that is most suitable in the interest of both parties.'

2025-02-07T16:54:41+00:00,-1001694389100,"—❗️🇮🇷/🇺🇸 Supreme Leader of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khamenei: 'Negotiations with the United States are useless, and will not benefit the country in any way'

In his speech today, the Supreme Leader once again emphasized that negotiating with the U.S. is not of any benefit to the Iranian nation:

'For some time now, you have been hearing, in newspapers, in cyberspace, and in the words of various people, that there is discussion about negotiations with America.

They mention the word 'negotiation', saying, 'Sir, negotiation is a good thing,' as if someone is opposed to the goodness of negotiation. Today, the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is one of the busiest foreign ministries globally. That is its job, after all. It negotiates with countries around the world — Eastern, Western, all kinds — it travels back and forth, speaks, and signs agreements.

The exception that exists is America. Of course, I do not mention the Zionist regime because it is not a real country. The Zionist regime is a gang of criminals who came and occupied a land and are committing crimes. That is not a subject of discussion. The exception is America. Why is it an exception? What is the reason?

Negotiating with America has no effect on solving the country's problems. We must understand this. They should not make it seem as if sitting at the table with that government will solve this or that problem. No, not at all.

No problem is solved through negotiations with America. The reason? Experience. In the 2010's, we sat down and negotiated with America for about two years. A treaty was formed with them (JCPOA).

Our government sat down and negotiated. They went, came, sat, stood, negotiated, talked, laughed, shook hands, became friends — they did everything. A treaty was formed. In this treaty, the Iranian side was very generous. It gave many concessions to the other side. But the Americans did not implement the treaty.

The very person who is now in office [Trump] tore up this treaty. He said, 'I will tear it up,' and he did. Even before he came, those with whom this treaty was signed did not implement it. The treaty was meant to lift U.S. sanctions. The U.S. sanctions were not lifted at all.

We should learn from this experience. We gave concessions, we negotiated, we compromised, but we did not achieve any result. That is what happened. Even this treaty, with all the concessions we gave, was still undermined, violated, and torn apart by the other side. 

Negotiating with such a government should not be done. Negotiation with them is neither wise, nor intelligent, nor honorable. We must solve our problems internally, not relying on outside factors.

As for the Americans, they comment on us, they talk, they express their opinions, they issue threats. If they threaten us, we will threaten them. If they carry out their threat, we will carry out our threat as well. If they violate the security of our nation, we will undoubtedly violate their security as well. This is our duty.'

2025-01-21T13:49:29+00:00,-1001694389100,"I personally believe that Israel is gearing up to annex the Palestinian controlled parts of The West Bank. Here are a few reasons why. 

1. In their briefings and announcements on ""anti-terrorist operations"" in the West Bank, the IDF has begun referring to the West Bank as ""Judea and Samaria"". Judea and Samaria is the Israeli term for the West Bank (excluding east Jerusalem). They control 230 settlements there, with another 165 ""islands"" which are under partial or total Palestinian authority (PA) administration (there are anti-PA resistance groups which operate there too). The fact that they have changed what they are officially calling it could represent a change in policy towards the PA-administered parts of the West Bank and while it may seem mainly symbolic, it could foreshadow the future of these territories. 

2. The Gaza ceasefire and hostage deal will undoubtably significantly affect Netanyahu's popularity among Israelis, and he will probably lose the remaining support from among the hardliners, nationalists, and far-right Israelis, which was already damaged after his first response to Iran after operation True Promise I but partially restored after his stronger response to Iran's operation True Promise II and the invasion of Lebanon. To retain what support he will still have among right-wing Israelis, Netanyahu may choose a war and annexation of the West Bank. The resistance factions that fight Israel's daily incursions into parts of the PA-Administered West Bank are much weaker than Hamas and their allied factions that operate in the Gaza Strip, due to a number of reasons including lack of manpower and no solid supply lines. This would make a potential invasion much easier and would almost guarantee success. 

3. The Palestinian authority has significantly warmed their relations with Israel in recent months, with the primary example of this being their direct cooperation with the IDF against the Jenin Camp Battalion in the West Bank city of Jenin. They have transmitted intelligence to the IDF regarding the location of Palestinian fighters from the Jenin Camp Battalion, allowing for precise Israeli drone strikes and even air strikes on certain areas of the city. The PA has also been fighting against the Jenin Camp Battalion on the ground, firing RPGs at buildings, and engaging in close-quarter combat on the edges of the Jenin refugee camp. The head of the Jenin camp battalion was among a number of fighters were killed in Jenin as a result of these clashes and precision strikes. This could suggest that the Palestinian authority is looking to increase their relations with Israel to ward off a future full-scale IDF invasion of the West Bank, which would undoubtably bring a lot of destruction to densely populated civilian areas. 

4. Israeli Defence Minister Katz has cancelled all administrative detention orders against West Bank settlers. Administrative detention is primarily used against Palestinians; however, many settlers are held in administrative detention too.

It's also important to keep in mind that the next Israeli elections are set to take place in 2026, and Netanyahu may want to prove to the Israeli people that he can secure a victory, with said victory possibly being in the form of a war in the West Bank and its subsequent annexation."

Update on the conflict in Ukraine for January 5, 2025…

On YouTube: https://youtu.be/bNtfKhLnE2E?si=02q1pqUh2_ENG4SB

▪️Ukrainian forces continue to suffer irreversible attrition prompting calls by Ukraine’s Western sponsors to begin drafting 18 year olds; 

▪️A French-trained and equipped brigade of over 4,500 troops is under investigation for large-scale desertions and reports of “abuse of power;” 

▪️Ukraine is losing manpower and equipment faster than it can be supplied to Ukraine, especially trained manpower and the larger units it is organized under; 

▪️A properly trained brigade can take up to 3 years to stand up, equip, and prepare for combat; 

▪️Western media admits Ukrainian forces are facing difficulties in holding Pokrovsk in the Donbass region as well as its shrinking area of operation in Russia’s Kursk region; 

▪️The fundamentals contributing to Ukraine’s incremental military collapse have not and cannot be addressed by its Western sponsors meaning only negotiations or more likely, Western intervention to create a Syria-style “buffer zone” will hold off a total collapse of Ukraine’s fighting capacity; 

▪️The US is likely waiting to maximize the cost imposed on Russian forces, its economy, and its geopolitical standing as the US places pressure along all of its periphery as the conflict in Ukraine continues;

Russia sort of just got a friendly goodbye from their overextended position in Syria that had to be maintained because of Assad. Most of the Russian equipment safely made it to ports and airfields to be sent back and they may even maintain their ports and airfield. Now Russia can stop focusing on propping up a liability in Syria as there was no real gain to be had with US control of oil and worsening tensions with Turkey and Israel. 

If I were the current administration I would want Russia bogged down in Ukraine, Syria, Africa and preferably another area as well. imagine Russia currently sending resources to Syria to fight HTS…

Seems like the right move again from Russia. Iran needs to figure out its plan quickly, I think we’ll be getting a new addition to the nuclear club."

Only the American presence in Kobani and Ain Issa can stop this aggression for the time being. However, after the fall of al-Assad's government, the Americans have no reason to stay there, and there seems to be no political will in Washington to confront a conflict against Turkey, especially after the change of government in the White House in January. Without air and military support the SDF will not be able to cope with a simultaneous SNA attack and Turkish bombing, not to say that Arab uprisings in Raqqa or Derir-Ezzor would bring about an even more rapid collapse of the organisation, and with it the end of any attempt at Kurdish self-rule in Syria. 
Negotiations with Damascus have also failed to bear fruit. Aware of the SDF's weakness, the transitional government and Jolani have called for the defection of the Arab elements of the organisation.

2024-12-06T20:03:55+00:00,-1001694389100,"— 🇸🇾/🇮🇷/🇷🇺 Big if true / speculation:

An important Iranian analyst on X, who has ties with Iranian personnel inside Syria, claims that Russia has assessed the situation, and it believes that an HTS takeover would not necessarily endanger their interests in Syria because they perceive HTS as 'anti-American'. Apparently, Iran has also assessed the situation, but came to the opposite conclusion, which has led to a rift between the two countries on the matter of Syria.

He also says Bashar al-Assad is much more receptive to Russian influence than Iranian influence, and that the Russians are currently involved in intense negotiations with him, while Iran is encouraging him to stand and fight, even offering to send forces.

The analyst also claims that Iran is slightly annoyed with Syria, because Assad allegedly refused to open up the Golan front against Israel, and I quote: 'Assad has been less and less willing to spend money or attention on the Axis of Resistance, he became less cooperative, prioritizing Syria's own interests first, being enticed by economic proposals from the UAE and other Gulf States.'

However, the infiltration was in small groups that either took videos and retreated, conducted a raid and retreated or were neutralized by government forces.

On YouTube: https://youtu.be/mTKyVw1Saxo?si=9I2mbub4ucz7yxUx

Update on the conflict in Ukraine for November 24, 2024…

▪️Russia has retaliated against the use of Western-manufactured missiles inside Russian territory by firing an intermediate-range ballistic missile with multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles at military industrial targets in eastern Ukraine; 

▪️The missile had previously been prohibited under the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with such missiles constituting the primary means of nuclear exchange between the Soviet Union and NATO in Europe during the Cold War; 

▪️The stark warning comes at a time when Ukrainian forces are rapidly deteriorating and the prospect of a widespread collapse increases;

▪️US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan has acknowledged that weapon deliveries aren’t Ukraine’s primary problem, but a lack of trained manpower, unrealistically urging Ukraine to mobilize more men;  

▪️The US is attempting to continue exhausting Russia, raising the costs of the conflict as much as possible, including through the possibility of wider direct intervention before Ukrainian forces completely collapse; 

▪️The prospect of Russia and NATO exchanging conventional long-range strikes continues to rise, thus also raising the risk of a nuclear exchange;

The Ukrainian propaganda machine is probably the best in the world in how it pulls attention away from failures on the battlefield.

Ukraine and its supports have to be the some of the most gullible, manipulatable and willfully ignorant group of people on the planet. Could you imagine if a catastrophe like what is happening in southern Donetsk was going the opposite direction?

By appointing a national security advisor eagerly provoking war with China inside its own borders, the premise that Trump was a ""peace"" candidate has fully evaporated.

Trump only ever planned on leaving Ukraine to start what the Neo-Cons see as the more important war with China, a pivot a hypothetical Harris administration would have also made.

▪️Western media admits Ukraine losing territory and cities at an accelerated rate; 

▪️Western media also admits Ukraine’s growing manpower crisis and an inability to address it; 

▪️Repeated claims of “North Korean” troops entering into the conflict continue to outweigh actual evidence and may be an attempt to sell Western intervention; 

▪️Western intervention in Ukraine will compromise Western dominance in the Middle East and Asia; 

▪️The West faces a choice of either doubling down in Ukraine or pivoting to the Middle East and/or the Asia-Pacific;

While the AFU are preoccupied with the southeast we could potentially see a Russian push for one of the three settlements on the southern front I refer to as the ""Crossroad Villages"". Limited road access in the open steppe of central Ukraine means that these Crossroad Villages will be vital for movement through the muddy season, which is fast approaching, but also for the winter. By that time the AFU will likely be in a seriously deteriorated situation and will have limited means to respond to fast Russian movement like what we've seen the AFU utilize in Kursk. 

If these three settlements are captured Russian forces will be able to quickly blossom out in every possible direction with basically no defense network or defendable urban developments.

What you are now witnessing is the visible signs of collapse for Ukraine, In my opinion it started 66+ days ago, but even the mere idea of a collapse after 2 years of a mostly stable front and attrition fighting seemed far fetched to most. Now the reality is undeniable. If you choose to not acknowledge it that is your personal choice but it is a fact.

 The situation in the south is so bad that I am now forced to zoom out to a distance untouched by mappers since 2022. The arrows are now large and the Russians are reaching objective after objective with much less Ukrainian resistance. Kurakhove will fall because the Northern and southern flanks are compromised, supply will be cut likely within a week or two.

This echos a similar experience after the assassination of Ismael Haniyeh in Tehran, when it was President Masoud Pezeshkian that wanted to avoid retaliation, but the Supreme Leader forced his hand, after the United States failed to abide by their promise of reaching a ceasefire in Gaza.

There hasn't been a missiles strike involving Kh-101 cruise missiles for 48 days. 

Currently at the Engels-2 airbase, there are 6 Tu-95s, 4 of which are probably equipped with missiles. 

Meanwhile at the Olenya airbase, there are 8 Tu-95s, 6 of which are equipped with missiles. That gives us a total of ~10 Tu-95s ready for use. This is a rough estimate, and it could have changed slightly over the past 1-2 weeks. 

Another indication of a missile strike today is the fact that there was training conducted yesterday. Training has come one day before a real strike before. 

Based on previous patterns of Russian aviation and the reports by Ukrainian monitoring channels, I estimate that there is a 45% chance of a large-scale missile strike in the next 9 hours.

I will continue to monitor the situation, and will update you if anything changes. I will also report on some of the drone activity under this post due to this risk of missiles.

2024-10-13T12:31:49+00:00,-1001694389100,"— 🇺🇸 Our updated prediction of the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election: 

Donald J. Trump will become President of the United States with at least 306 electoral votes.

Compared to our last forecast, Trump now picks up the states of Georgia and Michigan, winning all battleground states except Nevada, bringing his electoral votes to 306.

Georgia is a fundamentally red state, having voted Republican in nearly all of the recent elections except 2020 by a narrow margin. While we believe VP Kamala Harris initially had a shot at taking Georgia due to her support among Black voters, the lack of President Biden's response to hurricane Helene and Trump's increasing popularity among black voters has tilted the state towards Former President Donald Trump.  

Michigan is usually considered part of the 'Blue Wall' which Biden managed to hold in 2020 along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. These three swing states have been very competitive and influential in the last two election cycles, deciding the outcome of both past elections. 

Biden won the state very narrowly, and Kamala Harris will likely lose it by a slim margin, because she doesn't have as much support among White blue collar voters as Biden did in 2020. She also doesn't have the support of several major labor unions, unlike Biden did. Additionally, many Muslim voters in Michigan are not planning to vote Democrat, due to the genocide in Gaza. Jill Stein, a third party candidate, will skim some Democrat voters away from Harris. On top of that, Trump appeals way more to White, working class voters in Michigan, and his state-wide rural support will probably be enough to defeat Harris, who will gain votes mostly in large cities such as Detroit.

On YouTube: https://youtu.be/I6KxREw0Gi0?si=phNTKs8-n6ITjQrY

Update on the conflict in Ukraine for October 13, 2024… 

▪️Russian forces have made significant advances all along the line of contact including beyond the now Russian-held city of Vugledar, around Pokrovsk, and toward Torestsk; 

▪️Ukraine’s Western sponsors continue to incrementally admit the limits of their military support for Ukraine; 

▪️Limitations to Ukrainian manpower are also increasingly being admitted to; 

▪️Recent Russian missile strikes on Ukrainian maritime shipping have reversed the so-called Black Sea ""victory"" the collective West has hailed for months (if not years); 

▪️Ukraine's ""victory plan"" most likely entails Ukraine being admitted into NATO as the conflict continues, creating similar dynamics to the US occupation of Syria, and locking Western military power in Eastern Europe making pursuit of US primacy elsewhere more difficult;

2024-10-11T20:49:13+00:00,-1001694389100,"— 🇱🇧 Statement issued by Hezbollah's Operations Room (part 1):

– After the resounding failures and heroic resistance that the Israeli enemy army faced in the Eastern Sector, it has been trying in the past two days to advance in the Western Sector from the direction of Ras al-Naqoura and Jal al-Alam towards Mushairfeh and Labbouneh, trying to take advantage of the terrain that Israeli believes is more in its favour.

– Before attempting to advance on the new axes, the Israeli Air Force launched dozens of airstrikes together with violent artillery shelling from land and sea on the towns of al-Dhuhayrah, Alma al-Shaab, and al-Naqoura.

– At dawn on Tuesday, a force from the Israeli enemy attempted to advance from Ras al-Naqoura towards the border area of ​​Labbouneh with the aim of reaching the UNIFIL forces base in Labbouneh and positioning themselves there, but the fighters of the Islamic Resistance confronted them with appropriate weapons and forced them to retreat.

– On Wednesday, the Israeli enemy resumed its advance towards Labbouneh through three repeated attempts, but the Mujahideen confronted it in each attempt with rockets, artillery, and guided anti/tank missiles, forcing it to retreat, inflicting heavy losses among its soldiers.

– On Wednesday, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance monitored an infiltration attempt by an Israeli enemy force from Ras al-Naqoura towards the al-Mushairfeh area, so they targeted it with a suicide drone that exploded among the infiltrating force, killing and wounding most of its members.

– On Thursday, a group of Israeli soldiers, accompanied and protected by a Merkava tank, attempted to advance towards the Labbouneh area from Ras al-Naqoura, and as soon as the tank was within range of fire, the fighters of the Islamic Resistance targeted it with a guided anti-tank missile that hit it directly, resulting in its destruction, ignition, the killing of its crew and the injury of the soldiers taking cover behind it. 

– The enemy failed in four seperate attempts, over a period of hours, to advance to withdraw the casualties, as the Mujahideen confronted it each time with appropriate weapons and forced it to withdraw time after time.

– Hezbollah's fire support groups continue to target the gatherings, positions and logistical lines of the Israeli army in the military sites and barracks along the entire frontline and inside the border settlements.

– The missile force and drone force of the Islamic Resistance also continue to target military bases and settlements deep inside the occupied North, gradually increasing day by day.

– There is a complete and instant coordination between the leadership of the Islamic Resistance and the operations room, reaching the brothers stationed on the front lines.

– More than a week after announcing the start of what it calls the ground maneuver in southern Lebanon, the IDF still cannot expose its tanks and military vehicles on the Lebanese side for fear of being targeted, and positions them in concealed places, and despite that, they are targeted with missiles and artillery shells and suffer heavy losses.

– The Israeli enemy has failed, until the time of this statement, to control any of the strategic hills it is trying to advance to, and is satisfied with reaching some houses on the outskirts of some border villages with the aim of taking a few pictures and organizing media visits.

– The Israeli army uses the homes of settlers in settlements in northern occupied Palestine as gathering centers for its officers and soldiers, and its military bases that manage the aggression against Lebanon are also located inside settlement neighborhoods in major occupied cities such as Haifa, Tiberias, Acre, and others. These homes and military bases are targets for Hezbollah, and accordingly we warn the settlers from being near these military gatherings in order to preserve their lives.

Plausible deniability but I bet you that after the attack happens the administration will personally make a statement congratulating Bibi and Israel on “self defense”.

At this point my mind has been made up. One side is endlessly pressing for a regional war and I believe Iran should back down temporarily if they can possibly do so after this next hit. Accept the “humiliation” while maintaining resistance and focus on Nuclear development. Get guarantees from Russia (days away) and China and acquire a nuclear deterrence. After that Iran can come back with a new power balance in the region. I’m sure this is part of the reason Israel is acting so desperately now."

The truth is that Hryhorivka is a ghost town, heavily destroyed where it is impossible to settle (of course the reports about the capture of half of Serebrianka were not true). Similar is the case with Bilohorivka, which is empty except for a small Ukrainian presence on the southern hill.

Families in Western North Carolina need help! Our politicians have done nothing for the people of Appalachia, so we have decided to organize as citizen volunteers. Donations large and small are greatly appreciated. All proceeds will go towards providing relief to victims of Hurricane Helene in Western North Carolina in the following ways:

-Food and bottled water for victims
-Fuel for victims
-Toiletries and medical supplies for victims
-Fuel to operate equipment for relief efforts

We are volunteers from groups throughout the Southeast and beyond who are coming to the aid of a demographic our system clearly cares nothing about: Appalachians. We are being told that FEMA is out of money while our government sends billions overseas. Our people are suffering and dying right here, right now, and they don't have time to wait for government services that may never come. We are internally fundraising for our own travel, lodging, and food expenses. We are bringing our own equipment. Absolutely ALL of the funds received will go directly toward supplies for the victims and fuel to operate equipment.

Israel is starring down the barrel of a loaded gun and has no chance of survival if U.S. support stops or they lose control over escalation and deterrence. US support isn’t going anywhere anytime soon so the only way they can be destroyed is if they lose grip of the reigns they hold over the ME. Iran is the only force opposing full Israel dominance in the region. Iran just showed very clearly that it can penetrate US and Israeli combined AD with relatively few missiles thus removing a huge piece of Israel’s security illusion. They now must attempt to regain said illusion before it’s too late. 

On the other hand you have the issue of returning Israelis to the north which if this first day of incursion attempts was anything to go off of then that goal will not be achieved anytime soon or ever unless a settlement is brokered.

Everything the Israeli leadership is saying now, regarding the elimination of Hezbollah's capabilities, they also said in 2006 (quote above), and they still ended up losing the war.

Although a significant portion of Hezbollah's leadership has been eliminated, all of those high-ranking commanders have already been replaced. Hezbollah always knew that their commanders were at risk of assassination, and it's extremely naive to assume they would not have contingency plans for situations like these.

Besides this, Hezbollah is an assymetrical military force, its units operate mostly independently based on the initiatives of local field commanders. Even if there is no active central leadership (which isn't the case currently), the resistance will continue on the ground.

When it comes to Hezbollah's missile arsenal, Israel claims it destroyed more than half of the group's capabilities within the past week. However, this is likely exaggerated, as most of the airstrike targets were part of a pre-planned databank based on old or obsolete intelligence. Hezbollah is dynamic, it can move launchers around very quickly. 

It's likely that Hezbollah's long-range and medium-range missile capabilities were affected to some extent by the recent strikes, but not enough for its missile threat to be fully neutralized. It should be noted that Hezbollah's strategic assets, such as ballistic missiles, are stored in hardened bases underground. Many of them are located in Syria and the Beqaa. When it comes to short range missiles, that's another matter; Hezbollah will simply never run out, they just have too much stuff.

Hezbollah's main disadvantage currently is Israel's superior air power and surveillance. They likely still have the weapons systems to carry out major missile attacks against Israeli cities, including Tel Aviv, but such large-scale attacks would require extensive planning and staging, and during the staging phase Israel would likely detect the accumulation of launchers beforehand and strike Hezbollah's launcher formations pre-emptively. This means Hezbollah currently has to resort to 'shoot-and-run' tactics, sporadically launching missiles from blind spots and immediately relocating to a different location.

Hezbollah's real strength lies in its ground combat in the South. Hezbollah is intertwined with the local population, almost every southern Lebanese village has a Hezbollah garrison of a few hundred to a few thousand fighters, which are commanded independently and are well-armed. Most importantly, they possess an advantage that Hamas does not; modern Iranian-made ATGMs, in extremely large quantities. 

In 2006 we saw the villages of Bint Jbeil and Ayta al-Sha'ab resisting against the IDF for multiple weeks with only their local Hezbollah garrisons, in some cases only dozens of fighters against thousands of Israeli forces. The IDF was forced to leave both of these cities, taking a huge amount of losses. Hezbollah is much stronger now than in 2006, and it is better organized and better supplied. Israel is in for a hard battle.

The event that was expected

The Russian President outlined approaches to the new edition of the Fundamentals of State Policy in the Sphere of Nuclear Deterrence. The main changes are as follows.

1. Aggression against Russia by a state that does not possess nuclear weapons, but with the support or participation of a country with nuclear weapons, will be considered a joint attack. Everyone understands which countries we are talking about.

2. Equivalent nuclear protection will be established for Belarus as our closest ally. To the ""delight"" of Poland and numerous NATO pygmies.

3. A massive launch and crossing of our border by enemy air and space weapons, including aircraft, missiles and UAVs, under certain conditions may become grounds for the use of nuclear weapons. A reason to think not only for the rotten neo-Nazi regime, but also for all of Russia's enemies who are pushing the world toward a nuclear catastrophe.

It is clear that each situation that gives grounds to resort to nuclear protection must be assessed in conjunction with other factors, and the decision to use nuclear weapons will be made by the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. However, the very change in the regulatory conditions for the use of the nuclear component by our country can cool the ardor of those opponents who have not yet lost their sense of self-preservation. Well, for the thick-headed, only the Roman maxim will remain: caelo tonantem credidimus Jovem Regnare …

Hezbollah and Iran have defensive forces incapable of major offensive operations. 

They are capable of fending off US-Israeli aggression, not stopping it militarily at its root.

They have enough military capabilites to prevent successful full scale invasions, but not to entirely deter the sort of aggression the US and Israel are engaging in at the moment. 

To stop it at its root, both are playing their role in the rise of multipolarism, which in turn is undermining and displacing US primacy.

It will be a long and painful process but it is reality, not a Hollywood movie.

In my opinion, it seems probable that from now on, instead of mostly targeting Kiryat Shmona and border settlements, targeting the areas near Haifa, Nahariyya and Nazareth, will become a part of Hezbollah's 'usual' daily operations in support of Gaza.

As we all know, Hezbollah carries out 10 to 20 attacks on Israeli settlements on a daily basis to support Gaza, and these operations are simply the usual activity as the 'support front', totally seperate from the revenge that will be taken for the terror attacks in Beirut.

According to Israeli journalist Barak Ravid, citing U.S. and Israeli officials, Israel decided to blow up the pager devices yesterday because two Hezbollah members had raised suspicion regarding the pagers, and Israel did not want to risk the operation being discovered before being implemented.

A former Israeli official with knowledge of the operation said Israeli intelligence services planned to use the booby-trapped pagers it managed to plant in Hezbollah's ranks as a surprise opening blow in an all-out war to try to cripple Hezbollah's internal communications.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his top ministers and the heads of the Israel Defense Forces and the intelligence agencies decided to use the system now rather than take the risk of it being detected by Hezbollah, a U.S. official said.

Minutes before the attack, Defense Minister Yoav Gallant called his American counterpart, Lloyd Austin, to inform him of an upcoming operation, without providing details.

The RSF fired 5 artillery shells at the city of Sennar in the Sennar state of Sudan. According to local sources, they fell in Sennar's ""big market"" and the employees' neighborhood. Preliminary reports suggest that as many as 40 people were killed along with 100 others being injured.

The Sennar Youth Gathering said in a statement that ""there is a severe shortage of medicines and medical supplies, in addition to a shortage in the ""blood bank"", medical staff, and emergency equipment at Sennar Hospital.""

Sennar is currently surrounded on three sides by the RSF rebels following a major offensive in June-July that created a massive salient. The RSF previously attempted to get behind Sennar by crossing the Blue Nile river and reaching the town of Dinder. This worked initially, but the SAF managed to stabilize the situation by sending in reinforcements to conduct counterattacks, and propping up their defences in the area. The rainy season in the Sahel has also played a part in significantly slowing the advance of the RSF. Floods have killed hundreds of civilians over the past few weeks and significantly hampered any military operations in the country, buying the SAF time to dig in. 

Following the failed attempt to encircle Sennar, the RSF resumed direct assault operations on the city, attacking the key village of Majurno and seizing trench fortifications along the canal and near the pumping station, but from what I've seen, this offensive quickly ran out of steam, and the RSF reverted to their original tactics of attacking to the rear. 

They are also likely trying to sew discontent among the civilians who still remain in Sennar, and lower morale of the SAF by conducting these strikes. It is likely that in the coming weeks/months, these strikes will increase as the RSF continues to pound the SAF into submission. The SAF will probably continue to respond by conducting airstrikes on RSF positions and staging points for offensive operations, and conduct limited counterattacks on the flanks."

On YouTube: https://youtu.be/2-6R9KGUICs

Update on the conflict in Ukraine for September 1, 2024...

▪️Western media now admits Ukraine's incursion into Kursk has accelerated the collapse of the actual line of contact as well as compounded existing, critical shortages of manpower, arms, and ammunition; 

▪️Ukraine has lost the first of only 6 F-16 warplanes it received from the West along with one of only 6 Ukrainian pilots trained to operate the aircraft; 

▪️The loss of the F-16 was entirely predictable, it takes years to integrate new warplanes into an armed force, attempting to accelerate the process will lead to loss of aircraft and pilots in addition to all the other dangers they face (Russian air defenses and air-to-air capabilities); 

▪️Calls to loosen restrictions on the use of long-range Western weapons on Russian territory will mean diluting already scarce firepower over a wider area, raising the cost for Russia but accelerating the loss of Ukraine's fighting capacity further;

They're politically stuck in Kursk and suffering militarily for it.

You cant move manpower and material in under drone coverage and urban warfare. The gamble was Kursk, they may try something but I cant even see them reaching the starting line for a counter attack of any significance."

With the element of surprise lost, the Ukrainian advances have slowed. President Zelensky is still pushing for maximum progress, a source in the general staff says. But his top soldier is cautious, concentrating on expanding the flanks along the border to create more defensible lines. 'Syrsky is no fool,' his confidante says. 'He knows that rushing ahead risks the whole operation.' In recent days, an expanded Ukrainian contingent of 10,000-20,000 soldiers appears to be focused on establishing control on the southern bank of the Seim river to the north-west of Sudzha."""

The 72nd Brigade of the UAF, attached to the Ugledar front, is facing heavy losses due to inadequate orders from out-of-touch command. In just a few days, the mechanized infantry company has suffered significant casualties, with both soldiers and officers not being spared. The surviving troops are wounded and morale is low, but there are no plans to rotate them out.

Attempts to reason with the command have failed— the battalion’s chief of staff tried to argue with the unfit deputy brigade commander (presumably Colonel Onushko Sergei Alekseyevich), and as per old army traditions, the deputy took the chief of staff into a chokehold.

It is possible the author of this account is exaggerating somewhat—despite claims of our technical and material superiority, enemy artillery and drones remain active.

Nevertheless, the shortage of personnel is negatively affecting the 72nd Brigade. Our forces are steadily establishing positions along the Ugledar-Konstantinovka route and are actively targeting Vodyanoye with drones and artillery. It is also reported that the ventilation shaft of the South Donbass Mine has been taken under control. It appears that the UAF is focusing its main efforts on the counteroffensive in the Kursk region, and the situation in the DPR is of lesser concern to the Ukrainian command at the moment."

I suspect the situation for Ukraine has already passed the breaking point however and that’s why the commitment in Kursk is so large. Since April I’ve been predicting offensives towards Pokrovsk and they’re now ~10km from the city which I often refer to as “The Izyum of the south”.

Putin cannot fight a half-war and expect it to all work out. You either go in fully, or you don't go in at all.

2024-08-09T14:30:23+00:00,-1001694389100,Day four of the Kursk incursion and the frontline appears to be stabilizing after Russian reserves were brought into the region. The unfortunate part of dealing with manpower and equipment shortages is that even when you commit to something like this you usually don’t have the resources to exploit whatever breakthrough is achieved. Ukraine made a smart move and transitioned away from symmetrical warfare during which they lost every single battle fought since Kharkov. Kursk actually looks a lot like the Kharkov 2022 run but this time Russian lines in Ukraine were too strong so they had to go directly into Russia. Russia isn’t experiencing manpower shortages though so instead of a cascading collapse like we saw in 2022 the Ukrainians pushed to the extent of their logistical capabilities and are running out of steam. It’s also important to note that Russian logistics through their own territory is much simpler and they great strategic depth. There are still very big battles ahead and the Ukrainians are by no means exhausted but the rapid advances with light infantry on highways appears for the time being to have stopped.

The Malian Armed Forces' ""Bayraktars"" carried out a series of airstrikes on concentrations of militants from the Coordination Movement of Azawad on the border with Algeria. The main damage, as can be seen in the footage, was inflicted on the already infamous town of Tin-Zaouaten.

According to various reports, from 10 to 40 militants have already been killed. And these strikes are likely not the last ones: @departamente reports that many are trying to leave the city.

At this time, the Tuaregs are mobilizing, hoping to prepare for new offensives by the Malian Armed Forces and the Wagner PMC. Given that during the battle of Tin-Zaouaten they were able to quickly gather almost a thousand personnel, it is highly likely that the concentration of militants on the Algerian border will sharply increase in the coming days.

It remains to be hoped that this time the government forces will be better prepared for new clashes and will take into account the mistakes of the recent tragedy.

The fact is that the use of motorcycles in the armies (including in the Ukrainian army) is not a novelty but an objective fact for about a century. The use of motorcycles has advantages over BTRs as they are more difficult to reach and lighter to cover long distances in a short time, being very useful in reconnaissance work.
Obviously the casualties exist, especially by drone attacks, much more precise than artillery; but as always the absurdity and ignorance of many has no limits and it is better to continue with the rhetoric of “the lack of Russian material”.
It's only necessary to see how in the IIWW, where mechanized cavalry stood as elementary in the offensives; horse was still used for reconnaissance tasks.

This channel already announced this withdrawal a month ago and despite the criticism of some “experts” claiming that it was a lie, it once again proves that the facts are superior to the ideology and unhealthy belief that “the enemy can never win”.
Having said this, it should be added that once the Ukrainian bridgehead on the eastern bank of the Dnieper has been eliminated, the battle has shifted to the islands, a gray zone or under the control of one of the two sides that will continue intermittently during the following months. While the Donbas and Kharkov experience changes on the front Kherson will continue to have the Dnieper as a border for a long time to come considering the cost of any amphibious operation."

Moreover, the impossibility of an agreement with Russia will progressively harm the Ukrainian state. Russian President Vladimir Putin declared a few weeks ago that peace conditions should include the withdrawal of the Ukrainian army from the four annexed oblasts (without international recognition), which indicates that Russia is not inclined to return to that political reality before 2014 either. Ukrainian statehood is at stake and the prolongation of the war will emperorize its position until its status as an independent state becomes technically unfeasible. 🇷🇺🇺🇦"

2024-07-08T17:08:18+00:00,-1001694389100,"This strike marks what could be a significant shift in Russian collateral damage assessments. If a target needs to be hit it will be hit, hiding behind civilians works really well when your opponent doesn’t want to go through civilians to win. But after two and a half years of escalating war Russia may be moving towards a “gloves off” strategy. People are often mistaken when they hear that phrase and think “oh so you’re saying Russia hasn’t even started yet? COPE!”

No, Russia is fighting fully but the means in which they previously conducted operations were very mindful of civilians casualties. With some of the recent strikes I think that MO has died.

2024-07-08T17:05:57+00:00,-1001694389100,The likely intended target of the strike (if intended) could be the large substation building that was completely destroyed in the strike.

2024-07-08T17:04:46+00:00,-1001694389100,"Analysis of the damage caused by the strike appears to be sufficient enough to pass the threshold of air defense warheads and this is disregarding the visual evidence from the missile itself.

2024-06-14T17:17:55+00:00,-1001694389100,"Russia’s peace proposal shows the confidence of Putin in the current state of the SMO.

For those who don’t know Russias “peace” proposal is as follows

1. Immediate ceasefire 

2. Ukraine withdrawals troops from the four Russian annexed oblasts (Kherson, Zaporozhye, Donetsk, Luhansk)

3. Ukraine commits to neutrality towards the NATO alliance and agrees to never develop nuclear weapons.

4. Western sanctions must be dropped (the real kicker) 

Let’s just start this whole breakdown by saying none of this is actually possible. It’s illegal for Ukraine to negotiate with the current Russia regime and thus both Zelensky’s peace plan and Putins proposal are just diplomatic and political theater. Both side are just trying to convince the world that they’re attempting to make peace. For arguments sake let’s say that Zelensky goes awol and accepts the peace offer, he’s not the legitimate president and whoever replaces him will just void the agreement. From the U.S. perspective stipulation number four is admitting complete defeat in Ukraine and likely permanently relinquishing the title of global hegemony. Number four makes the deal impossible as well. 

What the proposal actually means: A lot of commentators and Zelensky himself have called the proposal an “ultimatum” from Putin and I think that’s basically exactly what this is. Putin is offering one last off-ramp (theater) before it’s settled through capitulation. Notice how he even dropped the “Sanitary Zone” around Kharkov/Sumy/Chernigov. Putin has proposed what any realist would call “a good deal” considering Russia’s current position of strength and the lines Ukraine and the west have crossed. There will likely never be another deal put forward by the Russians and this was Ukraines least worst option if it had the free agency to deal with Russia. 

With the outright rejection we can see where Russia’s absolute minimum objectives are. Zaporozhye will be captured, Kramatorsk will be capture and Kherson will be captured before this ends."

I personally think the best thing Russia can do is just keep taking the hits and wear out their opponents. The west is becoming exhausted with Ukraine and the Ukrainian regime can see it. If you were in a deplorable military situation and were facing a life in prison, death or life in exile wouldn’t you be doing everything in your power to get the west involved? What better way to do so then striking at the most sensitive parts of Russias nuclear deterrence. I think the Russian reaction you’re seeing right now is the best you’ll get, Russia is going to win the war as long as the variables don’t change. The Ukrainians are going to lose the war if the variables don’t change.

When the U.S. is winning we are much more rational and sensible in our approach to foreign policy, we seem to listen more and act as though we should take the high road in victory. When the U.S. is losing however (basically the first time we’ve seen it in 100 years) we act like children who are expecting a win to be handed to them. We don’t self reflect or learn from mistakes, we just double down on our previous failures and hope for different results. I use to think it was a Neocon/Neoliberal mindset and that they are the problem, but I think is just a cultural trait of the current west. I see it more and more everywhere I look, in both foreign and domestic affairs. 

For me this partially explains the “lack of seriousness” from the MOD when it comes to certain aspects of the war. Red lines (ATACMS, Kerch, Belgorod) should be adhered to by a rational party in the context of this conflict. Two nuclear superpowers exchanging blows via proxy is dangerous enough with rational players, but like I said, if the U.S. is losing the rationality vanishes. Russia is expecting the US to act like they have face to save. 

There is no excuse after a year of red lines being crossed but the Russian bureaucratic monster tends to be slow on the uptake."

“Oh well. Ceramics and Novokalynove are lost.

Now this finally closes the opportunity for our soldiers to make a flanking counterattack on Ocheretin and close the vanguard of the occupying group in a bag.

What's next?

The question is interesting. I tried to answer this before.

Since that moment, little has changed in terms of the enemy's intentions, given the current configuration of the LBZ.

There are already normal artificial fortifications to the north-west of Ocheretiny (in the direction of Progress-Novogrodivka), which also take into account the topography of the area (and it is difficult).

Therefore, it will take a very long and painful time for the occupiers to get to Novogrodivka.

A more optimal option, in my opinion, is to strike in the direction of the intersection of two highways at once: T0504 (Pokrovsk-Kostiantynivka) and H20 (Slovyansk-Mariupol, on the Donetsk-Kostiantynivka section) through the void between Vozdvizhenka and Arkhangelsk.

Actually, this is now visible in the actions of the enemy. That is why they are trying so hard to capture Novooleksandrivka, which is the gateway to this emptiness.

On the screenshot, I marked the parameters of this void in yellow, and the direction of the blow with an arrow.

What will it give the occupiers?

First, in this way they will form pincers on our right flank of the Turkish-New York garrison.

Secondly, they will pick up on the shortest possible distance.

Currently, it is ~11 km from the Siverskyi Donets-Donbas canal in the Ivanivsky district (where the occupiers actually climbed the canal) to the outskirts of Kostyantynivka.

If the occupiers capture Oleksandro-Kalynov and Yablunivka with a blow through the void, then the outskirts of Kostyantynivka will be only 5 km away.

And thirdly, the occupier will be able to quickly prepare a rush from the conditional Progress or the north-western outskirts of Ocheretiny to Novogrodivka or Selidovy. Which in turn will threaten Pokrovsk.

Conclusions

The situation is quite dire and smells like operational and tactical successes of the occupier.

Of course, the previous three points are a possible perspective, but everything does not look good.

The question is whether we will have enough strength to restrain the enemy, so that he will not be able to occupy the necessary boundaries in order to realize the above described in the future.

The second question is in what configuration of LBZ we will go into the ""traditional"" enemy autumn-winter campaign.

And the third question. Will our higher command take risks, or will it be traditional conservatism in approaches to planning and developing own operations at the operational-tactical level and above. And whether the appropriate plot will be chosen correctly. But these two questions are rather rhetorical.

In short, now Novooleksandrivka and Oleksandro-Kalynov are separated by 16 km.

And although everything does not look very good, there is still a ""safety margin"" and it is sufficient to prevent such a scenario in the future.

Our GS clearly understands this, so let's not breed ""betrayals"" when it is absolutely not necessary.

Everything is in our hands. It's just that each of us needs to work towards one common goal!”"

At least with this version of the bill most of the money never leaves the US and the rest will be returned over the next year. Ukraine was the ultimate cash cow for select individuals/companies in the west. 

Unfortunately if the money passes the fighting will go on and the death of the Ukrainian state is likely sealed. Mobilization will continue until there are no men left except those who fought for the continuation of the war. A collapse will come and Europe will likely see a mass immigration crisis out of what’s left of Ukraine. No men, no hope, no economy, just a hollow shell supported by the EU. 

If the money stops perhaps a settlement could be reached with a new regime. Not even a pro-Russian one because that would never be accepted but an anti-Russian regime that agrees to neutrality and can be negotiated with. 

I think the Russians understand that if the money passes (they likely already know it will through their intelligence) the war will drag on and in 6 months the new mobilization and equipment will become present on the battlefield. The Russian will be grinding through another small army in the Donbass for two years and that’s not acceptable. The strikes you’re seeing are not retaliation for anything Ukraine does, Russia has a set plan and these infrastructure and logistics strike serve an extremely important purpose.

2024-04-19T12:47:57+00:00,-1001694389100,"— 🇮🇷/🇮🇱 ANALYSIS: The Israeli missiles that were found in Iraq

Two Israeli missiles have been found in Iraq, one in Latifiyah and one in Aziziyah. Based on their exterior resemblance, they seem to be of the Blue Sparrow or Silver Sparrow missile type.

The Sparrow is an Israeli medium-range air-launched ballistic missile, which is currently in use as a target missile in the IDF, meaning, it is used to simulate an aerial target for defense systems like the Arrow-3, and in most cases it does not carry an active payload. 

Additionally, the Sparrow is a two-stage missile, meaning it consists of two parts, a booster and a warhead. The warhead detaches from the booster before entry. In two-stage missiles, the warhead does not travel much further than its detached booster, and the detached booster should be found not far away from the warhead's impact site.

However, as seen in the image above, even the closest booster that was found was located in Aziziyah, which is over 100km away from Iran. Based on where the missile booster landed, it is extremely unlikely that the warhead traveled more than a few kilometers into Iranian airspace, if it even entered at all, and if there even was an active payload.

After all this, while also keeping in mind the lack of visual evidence, it is inconceivable that even a single missile actually struck targets in Esfahan.

“New troubles are brewing in the Avdiiv direction.

In just 4 days, the occupiers marched 1 km to Ocheretyny and broke into the village itself, clinging to the southern outskirts.

Also, the events in Berdychi and Semenivka do not add to optimism.

And there are Umansk and Netaylov, which are already directly threatened by the enemy.

That is, in addition to the fact that there is a probability of a partial withdrawal from the Durna River in its northern part, the enemy can also break through Ocheretyne between the heights, between Vozdvizhenka and Arkhangelskyi, and go through the green and fields all the way to Yablunivka.

And this will directly threaten Toretska.

Or advance further towards Pokrovsk. Or both options at the same time (which is quite likely).

Of course, we are talking about the 10+ km that the orcs have to travel to get there. Which even in the current conditions is a very difficult task that requires a lot of ADDITIONAL resources.

This is just nonsense, Iran knew the exact number to send in order to overwhelm the AD and create deterrence. If they did serious damage this conflict would escalate beyond everyone’s control. The only way “devastation” occurs is if Israel just stood down and took every hit.

Israel had full intel and the strike is clearly supposed to demonstrate that Iran has the means to overwhelm not only Israel’s excellent AD, but also bypass every allied asset in the region assisting. 

Imagine if Iran launched 1000 drones and 500 ballistic missiles over 12 hours.

Pro-Ukrainian telegram 

“Chasiv Yar, Ivanovske, Bohdanivka

The situation is difficult.

Bohdanivka was lost.

The enemy also directed the main efforts to bypass Ivanovsky from the south and advance parallel to the Konstakh route through Stupochki.

Such a maneuver was expected, especially after the occupiers showed their intentions to attack Chasiv Yar directly in the front.

Hopefully further potential enemy maneuvers will not come as a surprise either.

Special attention should be paid to everything. From Mayorsk and Andriivka all the way to Vyimka, Spirny and Bilogorivka.

Because the direction has strategic importance. Precisely strategic, I was not mistaken. Because this entire wide area covers the Druzhkivka-Kramatorsk-Slovyansk agglomeration.

This agglomeration is the last under the control of the Defense Forces in Donetsk region.

I don't even want to develop the topic further, because they will be accused of ""treason"".

But the fact is that now there is a period of key battles in the Bakhmut direction, which will determine the strategic position of our country in the future.”"

An attempt to break through the border was made from the village of Odnorobovka, Kharkov region; the movement began at approximately 3:00 in the morning.

The enemy, numbering about 50 people, was moving towards the Belgorod region, but was detected in time by aerial reconnaissance. After fire from our armed forces and border service, the enemy was forced to roll back to their original positions, where they were covered with long-range weapons.

Most likely, the terrorist units of the so-called RDK and the “Siberian Battalion”, working under the command of the GUR, acted.

At the same time, the enemy tried to penetrate the territory of the Kursk region. Which of this was a distracting maneuver and which was the main one is unclear. Perhaps this is not the last provocation of the Kyiv regime on our borders.”

According to @epoddubny the Ukrainians tried to influence the information space just before the Russian elections in order to discredit the Russian leadership and military, by launching ""a PR invasion of Belgorod""

At the junction of the Kharkov and Sumy regions, the Armed Forces of Ukraine transferred the personnel of the Special Forces unit ""Artan"" which was given personnel, armored vehicles and artillery (5 tanks, self-propelled artillery, MLRS, more than 10 IFVs, and pickups with heavy machine guns).

As seen in the video, the Kiev Regime ""PR Army"" tried to camouflage itself in the winter forest belts, but things took a turn for the worse when Russian Border Forces discovered them.

Long story short, the kitchen sink was thrown at them (from ""Lancets"" to FAB's and Iskanders) just as they assembled their troops for the ""PR Offensive"" which resulted in around 70 killed and wounded, 5 tanks, 3 SPG's, 1 MLRS and bultiple IFV's and pickup trucks destroyed.

The fact is that each further line will be more difficult for the occupiers, especially when approaching Karlivka.

1. The positions of our Defenders will deteriorate in Novomykhailivka, because the enemy can roll into our positions from the rear. Not right now, but such a threat has ALREADY appeared.

2. There will also be a direct danger for the village. Kostyantynivka and S. Paraskoviivka, which are located on the Vugledar-Mar'inka road and cover both the road itself and the approaches to Vugledar from the north (rear).

Moreover, these settlements stand on the Suhi Yala River, which is a wonderful natural obstacle on the approaches to Vugledar from the north.

3. The recent activation of the occupiers near Vugledar itself from the south also demonstrates that this small town does not give rest to the enemy.

After all, Volnovakha is ~20 km from our advanced positions to the southeast of Vugledar.

I certainly do not undertake to say how it will all end. Will the enemy have enough strength for such maneuvers.

No one in the west is going to sit and watch Putin ramble about history. What will happen is clips of this interview will be produced and marketed to the different audiences around the world. China will get its clips, the U.S. obviously, Europe and the global south as well.

We’re so bored with the history and claim that Putin said “nothing new” but that’s like expecting Putin to release info that has never been seen or heard which doesn’t really make a lot of sense. You can disagree with him but he proved something very different in this interview from what most people in our info space are focusing on. Biden just put icing on the cake by surprising us with a 10 minute circus where he said Sisi was president of Mexico and wouldn’t open the border to Gaza… all while get roasted about is mental state…

If you think any part of the interview last night made Putin or Russia look worse off You’re either not thinking from the perspective of someone who knows very little about the Ukraine conflict or you’re so biased you don’t care and anything he says is Putler talk. 

It’s funny that people always hype up these interviews and this one was a particular case as Tucker was the interviewer. The reason this had so many eyes in the first place is because the opposition is very unstable and made it out to be something it would never be."

These attacks will primarily come from the Novokalynove and Orcheretny directions with the main objective being the capture of Krasnohorivka (green) or at least disruption of Russian logistics into the northern flank through that settlement. Secondary objectives would be the two high points which are both industrial hills next to the Coke plant(1) and the salt quarry(2). The Third and most important task is rescuing the ~3000 men garrisoned in the city and recapturing fortifications in the south(3). Evacuation is impossible currently and a large number of wounded are in dire need of medical attention in proper facilities which do not exist in the city.

Overall the prospects of this operation working out with an already exhausted Ukrainian army are not great. Remember the Ukrainians have been running hot for about 9 months now and that is counting the rest period between the bakhmut and the CO, roughly one month. I believe they have 4 brigades in the area and we may see Abrams and challenger thrown into the mix. 

Imagine if Ukraine pulls this off and saves Avdeevka, now imagine them doing with western tanks. That’s the last ditch PR play to salvage this war. Let’s see what Oleksandr “Salient” Syrskyi can do."

Ukrainian troops have mined the new sector which is where the troops are leaving from, while another group of Ukrainian forces are making a big effort to keep the Russians occupied while the evacuation of the city is taking place. The situation is very reminiscent of what happened in Soledar when Ukrainian troops began to leave just hours before the collapse of the front.

Because the plane is more valuable right now than the men.

If you don’t believe me I’ll point to some examples of Ukraine abandoning, killing, or sending its men on pointless suicide missions.

1. The war is still going instead of a negotiated settlement. If Ukrainian leadership gave a rats ass about its people it would’ve prevented the war or found a way to negotiate an end but chose war and self destruction.

 2. The POW camp in Donetsk that was hit with Himars directly on the barracks holding AZOV that were telling stories of what crimes they had committed.

The radar equipment of the Russian Aerospace Forces observed the launch of two Ukrainian missiles.

The Ukrainian leadership knew very well that today, according to common practice, Ukrainian military personnel would be transported by military transport aircraft to Belgorod airfield for exchange.

According to the previously reached agreement, this event was scheduled to take place in the afternoon at the Kolotilovka checkpoint on the Russian-Ukrainian border.

Considering that yesterday near Sudzha two IRIS-T air defense systems, which were dragged to the border by Ukrainian units, were attacked, it is difficult to believe that there was a technical malfunction. The Ukrainian Armed Forces began equipping the border areas with anti-aircraft missile systems at the beginning of the year.

On board were 65 Ukrainian prisoners of war who were preparing today for their exchange as part of the planned exchange with the Ukrainian side.

The exchange took a long time and was sabotaged by the Ukrainian side. A total of 192 people had to be replaced.

The Ukrainian side repeatedly sabotaged it and tried to infiltrate other people. Now the Main Intelligence Directorate and the SBU are likely to use the story of the downed Il-76 to accuse the Russian side of deliberate provocation and disruption of the exchange process.

If the Ukrainians send in reserves to hold the line at all costs the Russians will consolidate gains and settle back into artillery/FPV/airstrike attrition. If Avdeevka bleeds even half of the Ukrainian’s fresh reserves like Bakhmut did then it is accomplishing a meaningful task. Remember that the Ukrainian spring offensive could’ve been 100,000 men strong but instead it held at ~60,000 and was delayed until the summer because of the Bakhmut trap that Ukraine set for itself. Avdeevka is no different and this focus on holding the city will likely spell disaster for other defense lines such as the important area currently defending the Marinka-Ugledar highway (00532).

The Russians are also taking casualties in this direction as well but the Russians have a 5-1 artillery advantage, a large FPV advantage and only the Russians are conducting frontline air strikes with PGMs.

Seems like the whole thing was another attempt by Ukrainian CIPSO to present a fantasy win before the WEF meeting in Davos.

3 days have passed with 0 evidence to support the Ukrainian claim. No search and rescue activity, no photos, no MoD statement (mind you that Russian MoD, even if after a few days, usually confirms such things). Also keep in mind that photos usually emerge on the Russian side, with no harsh SBU-like restrictions and also a number of Ukrainian sympathizers living in the new Russian territories.

The statements posted by FighterBomber were mocking Ukrainian channels because they claimed he was on board and died.

Of course, some Russian TG channels jumped on the doom bus, and we, under pressure to report about it gathered what information we could and reported what most Russian RUMORS were saying.

So like the 3 Su-34's that Ukrainians shot down in their dreams, the A-50 also seems to be a product of Ukrainian imagination.

There was some sort of incident as shown by the photos of the IL-22 with damage, but Ukrainians claimed they shot down that one too.

Everything about this video is perfect, she is reading out the words of an oath that she can't remember from a smartphone while scrolling the screen with her newly done nails. 

The forcefully mobilised men are standing in an old crumbling Soviet era building that was not reconstructed for over 30 years of Ukraine's ""independence"".

All of them are dressed in different clothing although US and EU taxpayers have spent literally billions of dollars on their new military uniforms.

There is not even a hint of military discipline present in their formation, some of them have their hands in their pockets, while others are scratching their butts.

But the best part of it all is the new oath that the Ukrainian neo-Nazis prepared for the conscripts. 

Apart from the pretentious Hollywood inspired babble like ""I'm the weapon of victory"" and ""A worthy descendant of the Ukrainian heroes!"", they decided to add quotes strait from the graveyard of the Third Reich propaganda like ""Ukraine Über Alles"" and modern day cretinism like ""Putin is a Faggot"".

This video is soo funny it is an actual personification of the modern Ukraine.

Take Avdeevka for example, it’s basically surrounded and the only thing keeping it open for the AFU is massive reserve rotation. Reserves that Ukraine does not have to spare.

2023-12-05T19:55:40+00:00,-1001694389100,"From an Ukrainian Soldier:
I see that there is talk of a counter-offensive. I will tell about him from the point of view of the aerial reconnaissance pilot of the mechanized battalion of the 47th brigade, which was supposed to open this ballet.
We saw the preparation and training, and the planning and the assaults themselves.
*Extreme days at the landfill*
I think that both our allies and our command bear the responsibility for the failure. It is difficult to conduct strategic operations with 30-50% of the necessary equipment and no air superiority.
On the other hand, knowing your resources, you need to push away from them, and not scatter your already limited forces.
There was indeed a plan for Tokmak in 3 days, but more on that later. Let's start from the beginning.
We went through all possible ranges, training, courses and headed south. We were forbidden to interact with anyone, so as not to burn our presence. Spoiler, two weeks before the start of the counteroffensive, the enemy already knew the location of each brigade, the number of equipment, and the o/s.
Were we aware of enemy forces, fortifications and minefields? Yes of course. The National Guard, which had been holding the front here for a year, knew every bush, every landing, and any ordinary soldier could show us on the map the firing points, the enemy's traps, and provide us with photos of minefields from copters.
A week before the offensive, night and day shootings are carried out on the fortified areas of the enemy, massive artillery strikes, which we adjust every day. There is practically no response, for 20 of our shots, 1 enemy mine arrives. We were told that 82 and 120 mm are a lot, 155 mm is practically unlimited.
Image
But still we were preparing for Forward Forward.
Two days before the active phase, we receive a general plan from the command, which provides for an advance of 10 kilometers in the first 12 hours at best. At worst - 5 km.
In a day, we had to break through the enemy's first line of defense, bypass Robotyne and Novopokropivka, prepare a bridgehead for the next brigades that were to take Tokmak.
We understood that the command wanted Kharkiv 2.0
Was it possible with our forces? As British intelligence thought 50/50.
To our question, ""what's the plan if something goes wrong?"" We were told ""The corps command has a plan B.""
We had to interact with at least 5 more brigades that I know of, two brigades of the Assault Guard and three mechanized brigades of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.
The corridor was to be opened for another building.
Spoiler - everything went wrong, spoiler - there was no plan B.

This announcement comes on the back of his meeting with the general staff in Zaporozhye and implies that Ukraine will now be staunchly on the defensive for likely the next year. Remember the Russians started building the Surovikan line in September/October of 2022 while the Bakhmut saga unfolded and finished just in time for the spring offensive, so roughly six months. Ukraine will be implementing this strategy in three sections. Section 1 will be the frontline where AFU will increase the depth and effectiveness of Ukraines existing defense fortifications. Sections 2 and 3 will done through private means further behind the front. 

This is the final omission from the Ukrainian leadership, both military and political, that the Counter offensives have failed and now Russia has full initiative across the board.

The big questions for me are

will these plans be implemented quickly enough to actually assist in the defense?

What will the losses on equipment and manpower for building these fortifications look like? 

Russias deep strike capability with glide bombs, lancets, missiles and other drones presents very real issues for construction vehicles like bulldozers, cranes, cement trucks, and excavators. We saw some of that occur against Russian work vehicles from time to time especially close to the front."

“Update on the ongoing Battle of Avdeevka, now with a PowerPoint map that I can easily update.

The Russians have consolidated their positions on the northeast and southern high ground in the last two weeks and continued to claw forwards across the board.

I've marked key intervisibility lines on the map with solid lines and the (very approximate) Russian front line with a dashed line - although I will take pains to remind the reader that this ""front line"" is by no means a solid line of trenches a-la WWI and more like an imaginary line drawn between forward outposts.  Most forces currently ""engaged"" are located well to the rear in the built-up strongpoints (marked with circles) or even farther back.  Notable changes in the last two weeks, marked with numbered stars:

1. The Russians have seized control of the town of Stepove north of Avdeevka and started wrapping their front line around the north side of the AKHZ industrial zone.  Even seizing the first line of buildings in the zone will allow them to push on to attack the ""North Shield Line,"" an intervisibility line overlooking the one remaining Main Supply Route (MSR) running into town.  If they consolidate on that line, it will become extremely difficult to supply the Avdeevka garrison.

2. The Russians pushed into a small industrial district (marked SID) on the south side of town yesterday, seizing somewhere between half and 80% of it as of the last reports I've seen.  Securing this area will allow them to outflank the defensive complex at the ""Royal Hunt"" recreation area (marked RH).

3. The Russians have expanded their zone of control beyond the ""Terrikon"" slag heap from the AKHZ plant and seized some nearby terrain, effectively turning the Terrikon from a front-line fighting position into a secure base of operations near the Ukrainian stronghold in the AKHZ.

4. Russian troops have pushed the front line forward from the South IV Line and established a forward position near the town of Severnoe in the south.  If they can seize that town they can then push on to the ""South Shield Line,"" which overlooks the MSR at close range.  Taking this line will also make it extremely difficult to take Avdeevka - taking both shield lines will effectively surround any remaining garrison forces, as they would have to break out along the MSR under effective direct fire from Russian heavy weapons.

The Russians have fought off determined and large-scale Ukrainian counterattacks to get to this point.  The scale of Ukrainian efforts to retain the town can be seen in their sending elite units to try to stabilize the situation - first the 47th Brigade of Hundred Days fame and lately the 3rd Assault Brigade ""Azov,"" which has led to a considerable deterioration of their position around Bakhmut where it was formerly operating.  Contra to Ukrainian claims, the Russian assault force is only division-sized (quite comparable to the Ukrainian force in and around the town) and I am unaware of them having rotated any of the units that stepped off the attack a month ago for reconstruction due to combat losses.

The obvious military move would be to withdraw the garrison once one of the Shield Lines is taken to avoid an encirclement, although knowing the Ukrainians they may opt to see the place besieged and then try to relieve it a-la Stalingrad.  We all know how that turned out, so I wouldn't call that a wise course of action.”"

Firstly the red areas are the most defensible due to location, type of structures and accessibility to supply. 

A: Coke plant (large industrial plant perfect for defense)

B: 9th district (comparable to the citadel in bakhmut, high rise apartments act as high ground for defense)

C: longest standing defense fortifications in Avdeevka and the frontline between the city and Donetsk. (Russians already fighting and clearing fortifications here)

Secondly we have the yellow, this is just housing and is not fantastic for defense.

Blue: main supply route into the city.

Avdeevka is nowhere near as defensible as Bakhmut and about a third of the size, while also lacking the a Chasov Yar fortress city in the rear which was vital for maintaining logistics as Russia enveloped the city.

At the moment, new positions taken under control are being cleared, but the front line here is unstable, positions may change from one side to another more than once. different, so we will temporarily refrain from detailed comments on this issue for now.

Weather removes the eye in the sky for platoon sized engagements which greatly aids the attacker in making the dangerous approach to fortified positions where we often see vehicles piled up."

“Avdiyivka

Over the past 3 days, the situation on the route has somewhat worsened. But about everything in order.

The enemy had additional successes on the northern flank.

In the direction of Stepovoy, the enemy broke through 500-800 meters (west of the railway). Not fixed yet.

But the fact is that the battles are actually starting for the Steppe itself. And this in itself is bad news.

The lack of stable positions of the enemy here gives us an advantage, but it is a matter of time when the invaders will be able to gain a foothold and storm the Steppe from 2-3 directions.

Fighting continues on the outskirts of AKHZ. Our soldiers do not allow the enemy to gain a foothold.

An important clarification - there is no enemy on the territory of the plant. And if it breaks through, it quickly runs away. Now the fights are more than tricks.

From the Water, the enemy also had successes of a tactical nature, up to 200 meters.

Heavy fighting is also taking place in the direction of Pervomaiskyi and Nevelskyi.

The enemy in the entire direction has already lost more than 10,000 units (a very preliminary estimate) in a month of intense fighting. This is almost 1 enemy battalion per day is eliminated.

But the occupier retains its fighting capacity. Moreover, they began to introduce reserves very punctually and in limited quantities.

That is, they are in no hurry to introduce them en masse and are waiting for the right opportunity to do it.

Everything depends very much on the battles for the Steppe.

We keep our fists for our boys! It is unreal difficult for them now. It is our duty to inform them!”

Newly captured Ru positions along the northern rail line heading into Avdeevka have now been consolidated along with the industrial hill. Ru next move will be assaulting Stepove in the north and Sieverne in the south. After these two small settlements are captured Avdeevka is practically finished as the MSR will be under an unbelievable amount of pressure. Operations into the coke plant are also possible but I suspect they will only enter when the Ukrainians pull out or a massive opportunity presents itself. The Russians will also be assaulting to the north towards Novokalynove and Keramik if these towns fall and Ru consolidates positions the northern flank will be secured and Ua will have very little hope of returning the hill and Krasnohorivka, basically no hope for reversing the encirclement. Additionally, if this northern push is successful Ru will be able to expand its northern flank along the railroad tracks which is also a high elevation area (yellow arrow). At the entrance of Avdeevka we can expect minor assault used to fix Ua in positions and reduce the flexibility of the defenders. I’m not expecting much progress here but the old base (red box) is a Ua strongpoint which is a thorn in Ru side and will probably be considered for offensive actions. 

All in all this will be another slow methodical operation just like Bakhmut with the only difference being size, Avdeevka is much smaller and will likely fall quicker considering it doesn’t have a fortress behind it like Chasov Yar.

Ru is in a much more advantageous position with its housing of troops when it come to having heat for winter. Donetsk has power and heating where Avdeevka will be much more brutal for the boys siting in destroyed buildings. Rotation is also much simpler for Ru and will add another level of difficulty to Ua defense of the city."

As it turned out, the morning attempt to strike Crimea with Neptune anti-ship missiles and the subsequent attack on Strelkovoy were not the only ones that day.

Almost at the same time as the missile raid on the Kherson region, the Ukrainian Armed Forces again tried to hit Sevastopol with three Neptunes in the period from 11:10 to 12:04, bringing the total number to five that day.

Apparently, the anti-ship complex was planned to strike Black Sea Fleet ships and ammunition depots. All missiles were destroyed by Su-27SM and Su-27P naval aviation fighters 40-90 km northwest of Sevastopol.

At the same time, a MiG-31BM fighter of the Black Sea Fleet took off from the Belbek airfield, whose onboard radar detected two tactical aircraft of the Ukrainian Air Force and hit them with guided missiles.

The exact type of aircraft is unknown, but with a high degree of probability it is either a MiG-29 or Su-27. The effectiveness of both the MiG-31 and S-400 in conjunction with the A-50 is proving increasingly effective. This allows us to hope for a more active fight against Storm Shadow cruise missile carriers.”

Think back to early SMO Kharkov operation when Ru special forces B-lined down Main Street looking for a Kherson situation but instead walked into Grozny. Imagine if the Russians decided to seriously reinforce and pushed, neglecting obvious manpower shortages for such a battle, into Kharkov with force and attempted to take the city block by block. The casualties from such an operation would have been extremely high for likely marginal progress. Israel will most likely continue sending in first wave style probing attacks with limited to no success.

Without a double strike from both flanks, it will be extremely difficult for the enemy to achieve the goal of encircling our garrison.

While there are signs of preparations for new massive assaults. It will be even harder. After all, the enemy is running out of time. They are in a hurry.

Our task is to prevent the enemy from entrenching west of the railway and on AKHZ. Everything else is more or less under control now.”

A huge glow, a cloud of smoke and numerous secondary detonations make it possible to roughly estimate the amount of ammunition located there. Outwardly, this strongly resembles the May visit to a similar facility in Khmelnitsky, where, among other things, depleted uranium shells supplied from Britain were stored.

Coordinates: 50.2564822, 26.9689072

When analyzing the latest attacks by the Russian Armed Forces on the warehouses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, one can notice that the enemy often stores ammunition in long-known explored arsenals. This can be explained by their remoteness from populated areas and prying eyes, as well as the presence of special infrastructure.

It is curious that after the arrivals, local authorities managed to announce the downing of “all 11 out of 11” Geran-2 drones flying in the Khmelnitsky region. The results of such a successful interception can be seen in videos that have surfaced on the Internet.”

situation as of 13.00 October 24, 2023

Fighting continues around the Avdeevsky fortified area. After clearing the waste heap, Russian soldiers went on the defensive and consolidated in the occupied areas, while the enemy, on the contrary, pulled in reinforcements for a counterattack.

Due to heavy losses, at least one battalion of the 47th mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine was transferred to Ocheretino and Novobakhmutovka from the Orekhovsky site. Their forces of the Ukrainian Armed Forces tried to strike positions near the waste heap, but to no avail.

Similar enemy counterattacks were carried out by the coke plant in Avdeevka, as well as on Opytnoye and Pervomaisky. Ukrainian formations intended to occupy the gray zone, but by artillery strikes of the Russian Armed Forces they were forced back to their original positions.

Russian aviation and artillery continue to work on enemy lines. The losses of the Armed Forces of Ukraine are growing: according to sources, during a week of active fighting, the number of killed members of the Armed Forces of Ukraine alone exceeded 1 thousand people and 60 pieces of equipment.

There are losses on our side, too, but thanks to the chosen tactics of total destruction of the fortified area and subsequent clearing of the area, our command managed to reduce their number to a minimum.”

If it doesn’t commit to the invasion Hamas could be left intact and that would be a victory at the end of the day, remember this attack was planned for two years and was basically a Hail Mary. If it commits and the above post is correct Israel could be looking at a nightmare war inside is country and would be left extremely vulnerable on other fronts. If Israel does go in the US will have to shift focus away from Ukraine to protect Israel. I believe that this post is the US trying to avert a ground invasion but the bombing can’t continue indefinitely without causing a humanitarian crisis and a horrible image for the western alliance (mainly the US).

The Russians have the initiative on every front and have been on a decently sized offensive for the last 5 days on the Avdeevka area. Is this finally the Russian offensive that everyone has been waiting for or are the Russians approaching the battlefield with a different strategy then the Ukrainians did over there failed summer offensive?

It’s easy to want to give into emotions and expect some grandiose response, but when thinking cold and calculated it appears that the right decision is keep winning the war and don’t let your enemies control your moves. The only thing can come from a stern Russian response is propaganda opportunities. The Ukrainian leadership doesn’t give a fuck about the people of Ukraine or any possible damage Russia could cause. Even killing Zelensky or just hypothetically the entire Ukrainian leadership would only create opportunities for the west. The west is already fatigued and looking less the enthusiastic with regards to the Ukraine project. It would be a good idea for Russia to react internally and mitigate some of the embarrassments and losses they take on the chin regularly though, but it’s hard for old dogs to learn new tricks and Russia will be Russia."

ATACMS showed up just as most remaining AFU artillery is moving from Zaporozhye to Donetsk and right at the beginning of the Russian initiative. The Bradleys and Leo’s have already tossed their turrets and the men supporting those machines have blue and yellow flags marking their permanent positions. I don’t understand who’s running the show in the west but this is just a gift to Russia.

(Make out of it what ever you want) 
-- 
 
""I’m reading the news now and I don’t understand where the ideas come from that the offensive turned out to be a “failure”?- 
 
The forces of the 114th brigade took control of the waste heap in the KHZ area, which gives a huge plus for reconnaissance and more. 
 
No one will put artillery on it, as armchair experts think, because this is a lost cause that will entail heavy losses. 
 
How could we lose so many tanks? 
Almost all the structures of the Armed Forces of Ukraine in the directions of Donetsk are underground + this is a plain that is perfectly covered by our tanks from a distance; the fortifications are stormed only by infantry with the support of artillery, so that ours can come much closer to the position. 
 
This is why difficulties arise, because it is absolutely not profitable for us to break through all these fortifications, and it sounds like science fiction. 
 
The success of the offensive is shown from the village's perspective. Krasnohorivka towards Berdychi, where there are no fortified structures 12 meters underground, where every centimeter is filled with concrete, and on top there is a small hill of earth, like in the Donetsk direction. 
 
Every 100 meters covered in the Experienced/Vodyany direction is a huge victory. 
And most importantly - the waste heap. 
 
Now our guys need to gain a foothold in positions, and reconnaissance needs to identify the remaining ammunition depots and track the delivery of new units of equipment/ammunition/provisions and destroy them. 
 
Monitor every rotation and exit of the enemy from positions and prevent any withdrawal of Ukrainian Armed Forces personnel. 
 
The goals are clear, the goals are adequate, it’s only a matter of time. 
And you should forget about the cauldron for the near future if you don’t want to see a bloody meat grinder of our guys.""

A number of episodes are filming from other angles of materials previously published by us (also many thanks to the 40th Guards for the footage), which can be found under the tag #Novomayorskoye, but most of this film is 100 percent unique episodes documenting and revealing in more detail the feat of the Kamchatka Guardsmen , operating jointly with 30 and 200 artillery brigades, as well as special forces groups of the 14th Guards Brigade and detachments of the Cascade OBTF.

I would like to note the coordinated work of aerial reconnaissance, artillery, ATGM operators, attack drone pilots and other units, which made it possible to inflict accurate fire damage in a short time. Thanks to the saturation of the combat formations of the 40th Guards with various drones, the enemy was only able to cling to the northwestern outskirts with huge losses, manage to get ragged in shooting battles against marines from the DShB and ""Storm"", and ultimately be buried in pre-targeted positions that were easy for him. fed.""

And a few words about the guardsmen of the 40th brigade. Heroes in black berets are talented not only in destroying the enemy, but also in providing information support for their own actions. Now these shots are a glorious story, the pages of which have become part of the glorious combat path of the 40th Guards Marine Brigade! Guys, you are heroes! Take care of yourself!”"

The problem for the Ukrainian army is that the attack on Verbove comes from a fire bear, and all supply lines are under fire. The video clearly shows that all the roads have turned into roads of life, which are constantly under fire, which is why the Ukrainian Armed Forces are losing some of their reserves.

Along the entire length of the Rabotino-Verbovoye line, Ukrainian troops were bogged down, and the rains came in, which would make the steppe impassable. The General Staff changed its strategy and created groups that go on foot to carry out the assault, but the enemy began to lay anti-personnel mines, which greatly complicates the task for the Ukrainian Armed Forces.

Mobile mortar groups are trying to support the infantry, reaching Russian positions at night up to 5 km away, but cannot inflict serious blows on them, since the enemy is well entrenched and has built entire defense lines underground.

Enemy troops have become more technically savvy. They have developed compact and highly camouflaged electronic warfare systems to shoot down cheap commercial surveillance drones. In our situation, the use of Starlinks has become dangerous, since the signal is quickly determined and the flight arrives there. In fact, the Azov operation has become a new meat grinder in which the Ukrainian Armed Forces are forced to spend reserves in order to maintain the illusion of a counter-offensive.

It’s easy to want to give into emotions and expect some grandiose response, but when thinking cold and calculated it appears that the right decision is keep winning the war and don’t let your enemies control your moves. The only thing can come from a stern Russian response is propaganda opportunities. The Ukrainian leadership doesn’t give a fuck about the people of Ukraine or any possible damage Russia could cause. Even killing Zelensky or just hypothetically the entire Ukrainian leadership would only create opportunities for the west. The west is already fatigued and looking less the enthusiastic with regards to the Ukraine project. It would be a good idea for Russia to react internally and mitigate some of the embarrassments and losses they take on the chin regularly though, but it’s hard for old dogs to learn new tricks and Russia will be Russia."
2023-09-23T03:38:37+00:00,-1001694389100,"⚡️🇷🇺🇺🇦🚀 Complex AFU Missile Attack on #Crimea⚡️

🗓 Let's summarise today's AFU attack on #Crimea, during which they used both UAVs and missile weapons.

▪️ 1st, a Neptun antiship missile was fired from the vicinity of #Tuzlov, which was shot down along with 2 UAVs in the west of the peninsula.

▪️ And then 4 Ukrainian Su-24M bombers from the #Starokonstantinov Airbase launched 7 Storm Shadow Cruise Missiles. 5 of them were fired from the area of #Voznesensk and 2 more from the Black Sea area near #Ochakov from a height of up to 50 m above the water.

▪️ 4 missiles were shot down by the 31st Air Force and Air Defence Division: 1st over #Vnukovo, 2nd on the approach to #Gvardeyskoye, 3rd over the Bakhchisaray district, and 4th near Nakhimov Square in #Sevastopol (fragments fell near the Lunacharsky Theatre).

▪️ 3 missiles could not be intercepted, and they hit the General Staff of the Black Sea Fleet HQ. At the time in the building was no one but the duty service. And the information about the death of the Black Sea Fleet commander, dispersed by the Ukrainian media, does not correspond to reality.

💥 The AFU attacks on #Crimea are becoming more and combined. Drones, antiship systems, and cruise missiles are being used, which complicates the operation of air defences. Even now, drones are being detected in the skies over #Crimea.

❗️And this became possible due to the absence of any at least equivalent reaction to the incidents on the part of the Russian command. Attacks on fuel storage facilities and oil depots are, of course, not bad, but they will not give the desired effect and result.

📌 As long as there are no attacks on control bodies and command posts, the intensity of attacks by the AFU will increase. Meanwhile, in Kief, the work of all Ukrainian structures responsible for regular raids, such as the GUR and the SBU, goes on without interruption.

Both were found in the lakes of the Zaporozhye region with their hands tied behind their backs. According to the BBC, they were killed in the rear. The Daily Mail claims that the reason was ""money disputes"". 

Daniel Burke is the organizer of his own PMC ""Dark Angels"", operating in Ukraine since the spring of 2022. The unit he created includes the same “volunteers” as he — former officers from the armies of different countries of the world. He disappeared in August in the Zaporozhye region.

Next to it is now the Smart mobile accessories store (marked in yellow). Also important for georeferencing the area is the Kapital pawnshop, located at the corner of the T-junction, opposite the Golden Age (marked in red).

As you can see in the video, a second before arrival, local residents look into the sky in the direction of Druzhkovka controlled by the Armed Forces of Ukraine (marked in green), from where the object flies (marked in orange), after which an air explosion occurs near the Golden Age, which is not typical for a conventional rocket, projectile or air bombs, but characteristic of an anti-aircraft or anti-radar missile.

In the local chats of the residents of Druzhkovka and Kramatorsk, there were also reports of the presence of aircraft in the air, which obviously cannot be Russian, since the distance to the front line is more than 30 km. In addition, the aircraft of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have already carried out unsuccessful launches of AGM-88 HARM missiles at Konstantinovka.

Thus, a Ukrainian missile, most likely launched from an aircraft, flew from UAF-controlled Druzhkovka along Tsiolkovsky Street in Konstantinovka and exploded above the ground near the Golden Age jewelry store.

2. Taking control over the town of Robotyne/Роботине and develop the offensive further south until the 1st Russian main defense line, it's also expected Ukrainian forces will open another axis around Novopokrovka/Новопокровка as many reinforcements came to that area in the last days.

I'm pretty sure the various NATO armies in Europe are out of field rations by this point anyways, most of those got donated early last year and I doubt they've been replaced.  Maybe there's no money for it?

This is the most massive missile attack on a single air base during the entire war; previously, no airfield has received so much attention and means of destruction. What's the matter?

Firstly, it is from this air base that Ukrainian Su-24 bombers take off, which are carriers of the British Storm Shadow cruise missiles. At the moment, these cruise missiles are the most dangerous and long-range missile armament of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, which the enemy army does not disdain to hit bridges, ammunition depots and command posts. Destruction of Shtorm carriers and their bases is the highest priority task for the RF Armed Forces.

Secondly, Ukrainian Su-24s do not stand close to each other on the ground like some do , but are hidden in concrete arched shelters, of which there are as many as 40 on the AB. Starokonstantinov's satellite imagery shows the scale of the Soviet approach to airbases and air defense against weapons, a legacy that now serves the Air Force. In order to get Ukrainian aviation, you first have to ""drill"" these bulk hangars, which requires a large number of cruise and ballistic missiles.

The result of today's activities will be known over time, but do not forget about the enemy's high awareness of all our missile movements, so it is possible that the Su-24 was relocated to reserve airfields at the time of the strike, we wrote about this in detail. Nevertheless, the trend towards an increase in missile strikes against Ukrainian air bases pleases, we should not stop.

Do you want to lose territory? 

Of course not but we’re watching a full blown offensive and progress will be made in blood. I’m still surprised how poorly Zaporozhye went and continues to go for Ukraine."
2023-07-25T15:35:05+00:00,-1001694389100,"Why does it matter? 

Ukraines counter offensive has failed in Zaporozhye and they have now turned their focus towards Bakhmut which is now a purely political issue. They’re hoping to destabilize the situation in Russia by retaking the city and it’s just a fantasy. We’re looking at D+52 and maybe capturing Kleshcheevka is the biggest achievement so far. The Ru MOD is pressuring the north during this offensive which will present a difficult situation for the AFU if their lines near Svatovo keep breaking. I know it’s more fun to doom for some people but this is basically the absolute best case scenario for Ru. 

Imagine thinking it’s a bad thing that Ukraine is once again feeding men and material into Bakhmut and achieving almost nothing. It’s also not overly concerning because Ukrainian progress north of soledar has been next to zero."

Update on the conflict in Ukraine for July 17, 2023: 

▪️Western analysts are claiming the recent alleged resignation of Russian General Popov reflects Ukrainian artillery superiority amid the ongoing counteroffensive despite the fact that Ukraine is admittedly losing more armor and troops and has failed to make any substantial progress in over a month and a half of intense fighting; 

▪️Western analysts admit Russia outguns Ukraine both in terms of artillery pieces and artillery ammunition but claims Ukraine has the “edge” because of its “artillery kill chain” which includes drones and counter-battery radars, technology Russia also has but in greater abundance; 

▪️The US is allegedly buying Hawk air defense missiles decommissioned this year by Taiwan. The Hawk air defense systems was developed during the 1960’s and the version Taiwan has on hand was upgrade in the 1980s; 

▪️The Hawk missiles serve as a very limited replacement for medium range air defense systems like Ukraine’s Soviet-era Buk systems and will not enable Ukraine to defend against Russian glide bombs along the line of contact; 

▪️Before these Hawk missiles reach Ukraine, they will require refurbishment, a time-consuming process limited by a lack of facilities and qualified human resources. Similar limitations are inhibiting further production of newer weapon systems like the man-portable Stinger anti-aircraft missile; 

▪️In the wake of Germany’s Leopard 2 main battle tanks failing on the battlefield, an even smaller number of US M1 Abrams are being touted as the next great hope for Ukrainian forces; 

▪️In another Washington Post interview with Ukrainian commander General Valery Zaluzhny, he admits that Ukraine doesn't have the necessary material means to succeed on the battlefield;

Galushchenko expressed his belief in a phone interview, stating that he ""doesn't think Europe will require Russian gas anymore"" by the winter of 2024.

Along the front line from Svatovo to Belogorovka, the Armed Forces of Ukraine carried out several attacks in an attempt to push through the defenses of the RF Armed Forces. Unlike other areas, in the forests of the LPR, Ukrainian formations advanced in large groups under the cover of several armored combat vehicles.

In the Svatovsky sector, units of the 66th mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine pressed on the positions of the 30th and 15th motorized brigade of the RF Armed Forces at the Krasnorechenskoye-Karamzinovka line. A little to the south, an assault detachment of the 66th Ombr of the Armed Forces of Ukraine tried to recapture the areas lost the day before during the attack from Nevsky.

To the south, near the Torsky ledge, mechanized groups of the 21st and 63rd OMB of the Armed Forces of Ukraine intended to penetrate the defense line of the RF Armed Forces from several sides with the task of cutting off Russian fighters from supplies from Kremennaya - for this, the Armed Forces of Ukraine tried to occupy a section of the highway.

A little to the south, paratroopers of the 95th ""elite"" airborne infantry brigade of Ukraine again stormed the strongholds of the RF Armed Forces south of Dibrov, hiding behind forest plantations in Serebryansky forestry.

A similar and almost simultaneous attack by formations of the 42nd Ombr and 81 Ombr took place near Belogorovka and in the direction of Shipilovka, where some time ago the fighters of the RF Armed Forces were able to dislodge enemy forces from several positions.

All attempts to break through were repulsed. There is no data on exact losses, since there is not as much news from this direction as from other areas.

In the area of ​​the Serebryansky forestry, after the assault at the end of June, the fighters of the RF Armed Forces switched to positional defense. For the past few days, the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been trying to counterattack, carrying out sorties to the lines of motorized rifle units of the RF Armed Forces near Dibrovaya, mainly consisting of mobilized people.

All enemy attempts to break through were repulsed by coordinated air, artillery and infantry strikes. Ukrainian formations use forest areas to mask movement. One of these sorties was discovered by UAV crews and the artillerymen of the 120th brigade of the RF Armed Forces worked out for the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

Coordinates: 48.990644, 38.034159

Despite all the efforts of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and the advantage in reconnaissance drones, the Russian army is holding back the onslaught. A similar situation is developing on the Torsky ledge: the fighters of the RF Armed Forces are fighting off the rolls of the Armed Forces of Ukraine and are moving forward with “creeping” tactics.

According to unconfirmed reports, the transfer of the new 44th mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine began to the already quite impressive grouping of troops ""Liman"" of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

As a result, the forces of the 1st rifle battalion, 1st brigade, 35th brigade and 128th brigade of the TRO suffered heavy losses, and part of the fortifications was destroyed. At least four units of armored vehicles were involved in the evacuation of the wounded and killed to Bolshaya Novoselka.

Since early morning, assault groups of the 65th mechanized brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have been attacking the positions of the Russian army north of Rabotino. As a result of the ensuing battle in the forest plantation, the fighters of the 1430 regiment of the RF Armed Forces retreated to reserve positions on the left flank.

The enemy was able to penetrate approximately 300 meters into the defense of the RF Armed Forces. A little to the east, servicemen of the 71st MRR were able to hold back the onslaught of the Ukrainian formations.

A little later, after regrouping, the Russian assault detachments launched a counterattack and recaptured about 150 meters from the forest plantation. At the moment, the fighting continues.

The purpose of the enemy units is obvious: due to the deployment of Russian troops at important heights, one of the few ways to effectively break through the defense is to use natural shelters, such as forest plantations.

Attempts to penetrate the defensive lines and gain a foothold there will continue. The Ukrainian command intends to provide a springboard for the continuation of the attack on Rabotino and its environs.”"

They have been boxed and have nowhere to go from there, and no cover, as in the case of the bridge. Any “triumph” is in the media only and contains no threat to the Russian positions in Kherson.

Kirby also said that the United States has the ability to monitor the radiation situation near the NPP, but did not inform about the current state of the radiation background. At the same time, on June 23, he also said that ""the United States is not currently recording an increase in radiation levels in the area of the Zaporozhye NPP.""

 Other statements from John Kirby:

Statement from Hunter Biden's lawyer: In a statement, Christopher Clark, an attorney for Hunter Biden, said, ""Biased and politically-motivated, selective leaks have plagued this matter for years. They are not only irresponsible, they are illegal. A close examination of the document released publicly yesterday by a very biased individual raises serious questions over whether it is what he claims it to be. It is dangerously misleading to make any conclusions or inferences based on this document. The DOJ investigation covered a period which was a time of turmoil and addiction for my client. Any verifiable words or actions of my client in the midst of a horrible addiction are solely his own and have no connection to anyone in his family.

In a message to Chinese businessman Henry Zhao, the CEO of Harvest Fund Management, Hunter Biden wrote:
""I am sitting here with my father and we would like to understand why the commitment made has not been fulfilled. Tell the director that I would like to resolve this now before it gets out of hand, and now means tonight.

Second message ""And, Z, if I get a call or text from anyone involved in this other than you, Zhang, or the chairman, I will make certain that between the man sitting next to me and every person he knows and my ability to forever hold a grudge that you will regret not following my direction. I am sitting here waiting for the call with my father.""

Roughly 10 days after the message, entities attached to Hunter Biden received roughly $5 million from a Chinese energy company with ties to Zhao.

According to the whistleblower, IRS Criminal Supervisory Special Agent Gary Shapley (who oversaw the agency's investigation into Hunter Biden), the WhatsApp message was obtained through a search warrant.

(Sorry for the novel)

So far 

•Prigozhin leaves to Belarus (neutralized/free)
•Wagner is broken up and incorporated. (Neutralized/free)
•Putin is holding a meeting on Monday so we will likely find out more after that most likely.
•8000 men took a major city center and southern military HQ. After which they preceded to drive 10 hours to Moscow unabated. The convoy was 1000-2000 men and vehicles at most. Little to no fighting reported on the ground. 13 casualties from aircraft losses, 11 of which were on a single plane that prigozhin has since apologized for stating it was an “accident” and he will be paying the families 50 million rubles each (not good enough but still means most were unintentional). Helicopter losses included a KA-52 with both pilots having been reported KIA bringing the total to 13. The convoy made it to the Moscow outer circles where they stopped and a negotiated settlement was reached. 
•This whole coup attempt lasted less than 2 days and wrapped up extremely calmly. There was no effect on the SMO or civilian life at all outside of traffic, see street sweepers in Rostov.
•This analysis is incomplete as we don’t know what the reverse side of the negotiations are. If it’s extremely beneficial for Putin and the MOD we can assume that this was a wildly overblown situation using information warfare and the Russian government was never in any threat, coup attempt stomped out with very little intentional blood loss from either side. This could also potentially mean that the Kremlin/MOD knew this was coming and let it proceed as a way of potentially consolidating power, weeding out traitors and solving the Wagner issue (Attached picture). This is what I would consider a form of “Psyop”, if the Russians knew, let it happen, and played it up to the masses that’s a psychological operation.
•There’s also the idea that this whole thing was planned by both sides and the loss of aircraft definitely make it seem real. I’ll let you come to your own conclusions on that one. Although for someone who killed Russians and 8000 of his fellow traitors they got off easy.
•Which leads me to the final option in my opinion. This was all face value real, there are massive problems in the Russian government/MOD and Prigozhin being the insane man that he is rallied and tried to change the situation by force. If this is the case he succeeded in just surviving for the time being. An even bigger win for Prigo would be if come Monday some monumental changes come to Ru leadership. It’s important to state that these change could be both negative and positive for Putin depending on what perspective you choose to entertain. If he knew and played into it then he wanted the changes, if this was a real coup these changes may be wanted or unwanted.

I thought some people could be trusted. That they sincerely love their Motherland as real patriots to the marrow of their bones. But it turned out that for the sake of personal ambitions, benefits and because of arrogance, people can not give a damn about affection and love for the Fatherland.

I talked with Prigozhin, urged him to leave his business ambitions and not mix them with matters of national importance. I thought that he heard me, but it turns out that this anger in him all this time only grew. A chain of unsuccessful business deals caused a deep-seated and long-lasting resentment in the businessman, which reached a peak when the authorities of St. Petersburg did not provide his daughter with the desired land plot. The arrogance of one person could lead to such dangerous consequences and draw a large number of people into the conflict.

I call on all PMC(Private Military Companies) fighters to continue to be sober in their decisions. Think about the future of the country, about your families and children. Such actions can lead to disastrous results. Now everything ended peacefully, without bloodshed, but it could happen.

2023-06-21T21:51:42+00:00,-1001694389100,"🇷🇺🇺🇦 As the Ukrainian offensive begins to culminate well short of its intended objectives, Ukrainian channels have begun to analyze their failures and it provides an interesting insight into the operational difficulties the AFU now finds itself in. ZeRada has this to say:

1️⃣Complete absence of surprise effect. The APU went where they were expected. Why the hell did the speakers of the OP announce an offensive there in six months? The question is open.

2️⃣Mistakes in the general planning of the operation. Kharkov relaxed. The command expected that the battle of the Sea of ​​Azov would be the same easy walk. There are no tactical surprises at all‼️

3️⃣Underestimation of the engineer-sapper training of the enemy. Conspiracy theorists even wrote that the Russian Armed Forces carried out mining covertly. This, of course, is nonsense. It’s just that even theoretically SUCH total mining was not calculated, although the Tsar trench was visible even from space.

4️⃣The RF Armed Forces were able to produce and accumulate a sufficient amount of guided weapons, both ground and air based. The equipment of the Armed Forces of Ukraine that passed the first minefields was met by Kornets and their counterparts.

5️⃣Echeloned EW front cover by the defenders. Combined-arms systems are also operating, and, which was completely unexpected, trench EW of the RF Armed Forces, which were not often seen before. The Armed Forces of Ukraine faced a loss of communication during the offensive, and FPV drones were ineffective.

6️⃣Massive use of guided bombs. Even at the stage of preparing the offensive, the Aerospace Forces knocked out warehouses and accumulations of equipment with UABs and KABs, preventing them from concentrating normally for a full-fledged strike. Residents of Berdyansk and Primorsk say that after the start of the Sushka offensive, they began to fly even more often. The Aerospace Forces do not spare for the key targets of planning bombs.

7️⃣ Alligators. Ka-52 are back in the game. Since the beginning of the great war, they have been written off by drone aficionados. But during the offensive, they were able to fully cover their troops, as if in a shooting range, knocking out the armored vehicles of the Armed Forces of Ukraine with impunity. Arestovich's stories about 6 downed Alligats are not confirmed by anything at all, except for his and Malyar's statements.

8️⃣Deficiency of air defense. A couple of months before the start of the offensive, the command of the Russian Federation declared the main priority of the radar and air defense systems of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. During this time, they managed to knock out a large number of complexes and their components. Therefore, when the offensive began, the infantry of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, on the contrary, was left without cover. During the Battle of the Sea of ​​Azov, not a single helicopter was shot down.

9️⃣ The human factor. One and a half years of war are beginning to affect the quality of personnel. Mariupol and Bakhmut, Lisichansk and Severodonetsk, Marinka and Vuhledar - the Armed Forces of Ukraine have lost a huge number of military personnel, volunteers and ideological fighters. Tankers and attack aircraft, even trained in the West, but consisting of mobilized citizens simply do not want to die. They sometimes break and abandon equipment (as the world press wrote about), refuse to follow orders.

Any subsequent offensive actions of the Armed Forces of Ukraine MUST take into account the above factors. Otherwise, this will continue to be not an offensive, but the destruction of our own troops."

This morning, an armored group of the 128th Guards Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine entered the village of Pyatikhatki, which was located in the gray zone, and from there the infantry swooped in and tried to break through to Zherebyanki.

As a result of the ensuing battle, the offensive was stopped, and the 128th Guards Brigade retreated to its original positions. Neither the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation nor the Armed Forces of Ukraine have confident control over the Pyatikhatki.”

▪️Two terrorist attacks this month (June 2023) in Southeast Asia have been carried out by groups backed by the United States government and its allies for decades;

▪️This includes a singer murdered in Myanmar and a series of armed attacks carried out on police stations in Vietnam killing 9 including several civilians;

▪️British state media, the BBC, and US government-funded media platform Radio Free Asia have attempted to spin and even justify this terrorism as part of a much wider pattern promoting and defending terrorism as a means to counter China’s rise and punish nations working closely with China; 

▪️The opposition in Myanmar has openly been backed by the US and UK for decades - fighting to reinstall Aung San Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy back into power; 

▪️ In Vietnam, the ethnic Montagnards had fought alongside US invaders in the Vietnam War, and since then have worked closely with the US through the National Endowment for Democracy toward separatism; 

▪️Much of this context is omitted from Western state-media accounts of the terrorism; 

▪️Both Myanmar and Vietnam’s current governments have close relations with China; 

▪️Vietnam, while depicted in the Western media as “anti-China,” has worked with China to build infrastructure within its borders and access Chinese rail projects to bring their products all the way to Europe;

Maryinka district, Donetsk People's Republic, Russia.

The most powerful drone is a kamikaze.

Fighters of the Armed Forces of Russia affected the tank of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

They filled it with 6 tons of TNT and other badabums and sent it back to the Ukrainian positions on autopilot.

The tank did not reach the APU position - about a hundred meters (it was blown up by a mine). The detonation occurred as a result of an RPG shot...

2023-06-18T12:28:36+00:00,-1001694389100,"Regarding the fighting in the Pyatikhatok area, you need to understand the following.

• A flexible line of defense is designed to concentrate and deploy forces in the most convenient way.

• The previous weeks of the UAF counter-offensive have shown that an entry or advance of several hundred meters does not guarantee consolidation.

• Each area such as Pyatikhatki is complicated by the fact that it is actually an open field, in which it is impossible to dig in. 

As soon as the Armed Forces of Ukraine enter certain positions, artillery immediately works on them. After that, the positions are returned back, and the Ukrainian infantry rolls back to their original positions.

• The tactics of the Armed Forces of Ukraine have changed, but there are still no qualitatively new, breakthrough solutions. Everywhere ""meat assaults"", and not intelligence work or sending powerful armored groups into battle.

• German Leopard 2 tanks are practically not used, which means that the order has been given to protect this technique at all costs.

• Last night alone, the Armed Forces of Ukraine lost a platoon of infantry fighting two tanks, up to five armored cars and about 50 people killed. The total losses compared to the previous week have seriously increased and exceeded several hundreds people per day killed and wounded."

The situation at the end of June 16, 2023

In recent days, there has been increased activity of the Armed Forces of Ukraine near the Valuysky district of the Belgorod region. To the north of Kupyansk, along the Oskol River, as well as in the vicinity of Bolshoy Burluk, there are forces of the 1st Special Forces, 3rd Brigade and several detachments of the TRO of the Armed Forces of Ukraine.

If during the attack on Shebekino, the Ukrainian formations pursued only the goal of PR, stressing the population and pulling together the resources of the RF Armed Forces, then the offensive in this area is considered as a springboard for further advance towards the LPR through the Belgorod region.

Ukrainian formations know that large military units of the Russian army are stationed in this area, and it is through Valuyki and Urazovo that one of the main supply routes for the Russian Armed Forces in the Luhansk People's Republic passes.

🔻However, the offensive of the Armed Forces of Ukraine from the controlled part of the Kharkiv region in the forehead is futile: both Valuyki and Urazovo are located on the right bank of the Oskol River, and the main defense is built along the river.

Against the background of information about the strengthening of the AFU grouping in the Kupyansky sector, a simultaneous attack in the Valuysky direction and from the Kupyansk-Kamenka sector with the crossing of Oskol is much more likely.

Thus, the Armed Forces of Ukraine can try to realize the long-standing plan of a breakthrough to the line Troitskoye - Nizhnyaya Duvanka - Svatovo, which was considered last fall, but then the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation were able to hold the defense along the Oskol River, and the 14th and 92nd Ombre of the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffered huge losses.”

Additionally, the enemy made two attacks:
1. Southeast of the Levadnoe settlement, with forces up to the Ministry of Defense from the composition of the 23rd Ombr, they failed, suffered losses, retreated to their previously occupied positions.
2. In the direction of the Novodarovka settlement - Priyutnoye, with forces up to the Ministry of Defense from the composition of the 31st Ombr - was unsuccessful, suffered losses, retreated to the previously occupied positions.
In summary: the enemy still cannot develop the pace of the offensive on which he counted.
The number of losses in men and equipment is disproportionate to the modest tactical success expressed in the occupation of several villages located north of the main defensive line.
However, at the disposal of the enemy command there are still sufficient reserves of manpower and equipment, the offensive potential has not been exhausted."

This is reported by the sources of the @wargonzo project, who are familiar with the overall picture of today's night battle in the Zaporozhye direction.

After a truly massive art treatment (not a red word, it was really tough - with the participation of ""Himmers"") 4 columns advanced to our defense line - each of which had 25/30 pieces of equipment.

The armored groups were divided into pairs, each headed by 4/5 tanks - on / in the rest of the equipment - infantry. Most of the tanks were blown up in minefields - those that were able to move on were waiting for our ATGMs.

Yes, the neo-Nazis managed to break through to two of our positions, which before that were simply ruined by artillery. Of course, we have losses, beat, repeat, tight and hard. Therefore, individual groups of the Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to jump on them.

The bulk of the enemy infantry was dispersed by our return fire. Some tanks had to literally be driven through the fields in the dark. The main thing is that the soldiers of the Russian Army did not lose their heads, behaved as collectedly as possible and gave a concrete rebuff. The enemy scattered began to roll back. Some groups still remain at our borders.

Let's sum up the night: our optimism is still restrained. Attacks and rolls of equipment will resume. Artillery fire is sure to intensify. We didn't let ourselves be crushed. Sell ​​too. The boys who repelled this night counterattack are undeniable Heroes.

The Armed Forces of Ukraine managed to form a much more serious armored fist. Much more equipment is involved than the day before. Only from the Golden Niva about 30 pieces of equipment (mostly NATO-style) advanced to our positions.

The main direction of the strike is the settlement of Novodonetskoye (it stands on the line just somewhere in the middle between Velika Novoselovka and Vugledara). There is evidence that the enemy is trying to enter the village.

▪️The incoming government in Thailand following general elections, funded and backed by the US for years, vows to adopt US foreign policy across the region, and specifically in regards to neighboring Myanmar; 

▪️This includes Thailand adopting US Congress' ""Burma Act"" which funds ""non-lethal aid"" for anti-government militants in Myanmar; 

▪️The US is waging a proxy terrorist campaign against China across Eurasia, including in Myanmar where US-backed militants have repeatedly attacked Belt and Road Initiative infrastructure including a pipeline earlier this month; 

▪️Thailand’s new US-backed client regime is enlisting Thailand in this anti-China campaign despite China being Thailand’s largest trade partner, investor, source of tourism, infrastructure partner, and until recently, security partner; 

▪️Just as Europe has destroyed its economy and future prospects by enlisting in Washington’s proxy war against Russia, Thailand, the Philippines, and perhaps soon other nations in Southeast Asia are doing likewise;

▪️Western analysts claim the city’s capture will not “turn the tide” of the conflict, ignoring the war of attrition taking place superseding territorial advances; 

▪️ The US is sending another weapons package to Ukraine featuring an unspecified amount of ammunition for HIMARS, artillery systems, anti-tank weapons, and both bridging and logistics equipment; 

▪️The US is also incrementally moving in favor of sending Ukraine F-16 fighter jets through third party nations in Europe. The F-16 represents no specific capability Ukraine’s own air force didn’t have before being removed from the battlefield; 

▪️The Western media continues incrementally admitting the limits in military industrial output preventing the US and Europe from providing Ukraine with weapons and ammunition to match or exceed Russia’s military capabilities;

It could’ve also been an attack timed around rotation but we haven’t seen much progress for two days now and the lines are currently holding which leads me to believe it’s a smaller operation that was blunted by lower quality Russian troops.

Prigozhin - use every little opportunity to badmouth the Russian MOD. Sometimes appropriate but very often he exaggerates. So please don't always take absolutely every word he says as true coin. There is also a lot of politics involved.

Yes UA puts pressure on the flanks. And yes, UA has reclaimed certain territories. However, many of these areas have been or have been a gray area for weeks. And UA is still very far from having made a major breakthrough. By the way, this back and forth on the flanks has been going on for exactly 8 weeks. But no one said it publicly. Only the people who made it public know why the whole thing is now being publicized so widely. In a war it is completely normal that there is a back and forth. Nobody can only go forward. Not even Wagner. They are all people and not machines.
But here you just notice that a lot of people just have the urge to talk bad about everything and everyone. Now just let the Wagner guys work and calm down a bit. Will do everyone good.

Give them strength and love. They can use that now more than completely exaggerated bad mood-mongering."

If Bakhmut end decisively for the Russians it could spring board them towards their next goal especially with the alleged arrival of Akhmat forces in the area (unconfirmed).

Keep your eyes out in a other directions where Ukraine could attempt an offensive action to distract from Bakhmut. My personal opinion is that they go for the ZNPP in Enerhodar.

▪️Ukraine shot down one of its Turkish-built Bayraktar TB-2 drones over Kiev after allegedly losing control of it; 

▪️Ukraine’s Air Force spokesman denied claims that Ukrainian air defense forces downed a Russian hypersonic Kinzhal missile. Despite denying the incident, the Western media continues writing articles about the “downing” of the missile; 

▪️PMC Wagner has nearly total control over the Donbass city of Bakhmut. Wagner head Prigozhin has aired differences with the Russian Ministry of Defense publicly in a manner inconsistent with military protocol and discipline;  

▪️Russian commanders have said that after weathering the Ukrainian offensive, they will continue grinding down Ukrainian troops in the same incremental manner they have been throughout the special military operation; 

▪️CNN admits Ukrainian HIMARS are being jammed by Russian electronic warfare, diminishing their effectiveness on the battlefield; 

▪️The EU’s plan to produce “1 million” 155mm artillery rounds per year is still under discussion, when implemented it may take several years to reach the desired output similar to US efforts to expand shell production;

2023-05-06T14:43:25+00:00,-1001694389100,"⚡️On Artemovsk throughout the day: 

1. Wagner Reinforcements; Despite recent claims by Prigozhin that the responsibility of the liberation of the remaining area of Artemovsk will be under the jurisdiction of the Russian Ministry of Defense and Akhmat Forces. Throughout the day, large reinforcements coming from Southern Russia under the Wagner Group banner entered the area of Artemovsk; this mean are most likely new recruits. The number of reinforcements is large, although can not be estimated.

2. Shelling; throughout the day; Wagner increased artillery shelling (despite an alleged artillery shortage) by an extreme percentage, despite Prigozhin claiming that none of his calls were answered by the MOD.  In the early hours of the morning, Wagner were able to completely level the remaining sector under AFU control with phosphorus munitions which prevented rotation and caused a large amount of havoc for the Ukrainians. The usage of phosphorous munitions on this scale were recorded over 124 times thoroughout the day. Similarly, thousands of artillery rounds were fired.

3. Advances; Wagner advances were around 250m throughout the day, and Airborne Forces advanced around 70m, the AFU voluntarily withdrew from atleast 20m nearby to the Jehovah's Witness Temple. Only 2.40% of the city remains under Ukrainian control.  Continued withdrawal of Ukrainian Artillery units from the Khromove Area to the quarters of Chasovoy Yar suggest that the AFU are preparing to leave the city altogether. The signs are here. 

4. Losses; Unfortunately, thoroughout the day, around 96 employees of the Wagner Group lost their lives. The amount of confirmed losses of Ukrainians reached nearby to the 600 mark. We cannot estimate losses caused by Artillery, mines, and phosphorus firing which took place throughout the day. 

5. Rotations; Units of the Russian Armed Forces have already poured into the city, friends and sources that I know are already being stationed in Artemovsk. They are helping with the advance.

I think it’s mostly just a way to keep Ukraines hopes of holding the city alive. They know how many shells are falling on their head and they know Wagner doesn’t have a shortage, but if the infighting is sold hard enough, perhaps your enemy will make a gigantic mistake like holding the 56th largest city in Ukraine for 9 months under an artillery and aviation disadvantage. Maybe they’ll disobey their proxier by holding even when they suggest withdrawal. Maybe they’ll throw some of their best into the fray to extend it even further. Maybe they’ll put their next offensive on hold as they’ve expended to much or even better they go on an offensive lacking the depth.

About the ammo problems and what I know. In general, Wagner gets quite a bit of ammo. And it is often enough to prepare good and strong attacks with artillery. What's the point though, since UA has ramped up their artillery fire sharply over the last few days, it makes sense that Wagner needs to fire just as much here or else they'll be pushed back. And here there seem to be problems and Wagner doesn't get more than they've always gotten up until now. And that's the whole point that upsets Prigozhin. And I can understand him there, as you've probably all noticed, there hasn't been much progress in Bakhmut in the last few days. This is also due to the strong arrillian fire from UA. They have increased that significantly, and that makes it difficult for Wagner to advance. Therefore, they also have to fire about the same amount of artillery as UA. But they can't because their ammo consumption is currently declining much faster than UA's. The latter have been holding back their ammunition for the upcoming offensive. That's why you have a lot more available at the moment. Now a few days ago they got clearance to increase the shelling and they are doing it all along the front now.
A solution must be found quickly here so that Wagner does not get the same amount of ammunition as always, but more. Otherwise, they will get into trouble very quickly and even if they are strong fighters, UA will eventually overrun them.

You always have casualties every day in a war. That is unfortunately the case. But with a lot of artillery you can reduce them."

▪️Russian missile strikes are also exhausting Ukraine's air defense capabilities at a rate difficult for its Western allies to replace; 

▪️Errant Ukrainian S-300 missiles falling into populated areas and causing civilian casualties are now regularly blamed on Russia; 

▪️Several of Ukraine's remaining S-300 systems appeared to be moving into Kherson to provide potential air defenses ahead of the expected offensive but were discovered and destroyed by Russian Lancet kamikaze drones;

The epicenter of the fighting in Bakhmut is currently in the NW. After several attempted counterattacks by UA were fended off, Wagner managed to advance right up to the post office. Very intense and heavy battles are taking place here now. The same applies to the Olympic school area. East of these areas, Wagner managed to break through UA's defenses and advance further. Wagner is now trying to align the front along Larysy Shepitko Street. Sometimes they are successful. Along Peremogi Street, Wagner managed to advance even further and reach UA's last line of defense.

I personally think that Wagner will soon be able to break the last line and UA will face great difficulties.

The Children's Hospital area and the Citadel Area (High Rise Buildings) are covered very heavily by artillery. UA can hardly go outside or they will be hit directly.

To the south, in the area where Wagner crossed Chajkovskogo Street, Wagner also managed to capture 4 more houses on the other side. The process of encircling the high-rise buildings is in full swing.

“Of course, I heard this audio intercept long before it hit the media. I can say one thing - this audio interception that the Ukrainians are shooting our wounded prisoners is of very serious humanitarian importance and we will never violate the international laws of humanism.

And the law of humanism begins from the moment you take a person prisoner. Captured - start taking care of him, treat him, do not injure him and give him home after some time on an exchange or just the way you like, we sometimes gave it just like that.

Therefore, we will not violate the rules of humanism and will simply destroy everyone on the battlefield. Therefore, this law will be called the ""Law of the Three Hundredth(wounded)"", we still do not know the name of our guy, who was shot wounded by Ukrainian scoundrels and we will kill all those who are on the battlefield.

The General Staff is urgently trying to change the defense tactics of Bakhmut/Avdeevka/Ugledar, due to the massive use of aerial bombs by Russian troops. The main principle was built around the creation of fortified areas from high-rise buildings, in which snipers were located on the upper floors, and warehouses and headquarters of units in the basements. In recent days, Russian troops have been conducting reconnaissance using drones, and then bombing the buildings, after which nothing remains of the houses, and those who are in the basements are simply buried alive, since there is no way to dismantle the rubble. The losses are so significant that the General Staff is forced to change the strategy for the defense of cities."

The intensity of fighting in the city of Bakhmut has regained momentum and increased. Thousands of grenades fly at UA positions that are heavily fortified.

Around the station, Wagner made progress on Polevaja Street. And clearly has the upper hand here. UA will soon have to withdraw a little further.

In the south there is still a lot of fighting over the area of ​​the Industrial College. Wagner managed to enter the college from one side. However, UA continues to resist fiercely.

In the north, the large garage cooperative is still being attacked from 3 sides. Wagner continues to make slight progress in this area.

To the NW, Wagner continues to advance south on Tolbuhina Street. The goal is to conquer the entire street. Furthermore, there is still fighting for the post office and the area of ​​​​the Olympic school.

As you can see, Wagner is currently fighting for very heavily fortified areas of UA. It may now be a few days before further significant successes occur around these areas. The goal is to conquer these fortified areas. But that is not possible in 1-2 days. UA is putting up strong resistance.

The situation on the flanks is extremely dynamic and difficult. Because of the rain there is a lot of mud everywhere. You hardly make any progress. Only infantry on foot is possible. Based on the current status, I would describe the road near Khromovo as a complete gray area. UA counters very strongly. Then Wagner attacks again and recaptures.
